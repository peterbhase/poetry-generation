ONE'SSELF I sing, a simple separate person,
Yet utter the word Democratic, the word EnMasse.

Of physiology from top to toe I sing,
Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse, I 
say the Form complete is worthier far,
The Female equally with the Male I sing.

Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,
Cheerful, for freest action form'd under the laws divine,
The Modern Man I sing.


AS I PONDER'D IN SILENCE.

As I ponder'd in silence,
Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,
A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,
Terrible in beauty, age, and power,
The genius of poets of old lands,
As to me directing like flame its eyes,
With finger pointing to many immortal songs,
And menacing voice, What singest thou? it said,
Know'st thou not there is but one theme for everenduring bards?
And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,
The making of perfect soldiers.

Be it so, then I answer'd,
I too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one 
than any,
Waged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance and 
retreat, victory deferr'd and wavering,



(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the field 
the world,
For life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,
Lo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,
I above all promote brave soldiers.


IN CABIN'D SHIPS AT SEA.

IN cabin'd ships at sea,
The boundless blue on every side expanding,
With whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious 
waves,
Or some lone bark buoy'd on the dense marine,
Where joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,
She cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or 
under many a star at night,
By sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land,
be read,
In full rapport at last.

Here are our thoughts, voyagers' thoughts,
Here not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be 
said,
The sky o'erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our 
feet,
We feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,
The tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the 
briny world, the liquidflowing syllables,
The perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy 
rhythm,
The boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,
And this is ocean's poem.

Then falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,
You not a reminiscence of the land alone,
You too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos'd I know not 
whither, yet ever full of faith,
Consort to every ship that sails, sail you!
Bear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold 
it here in every leaf;)
Speed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart 
the imperious waves,
Chant on, sail on, bear o'er the boundless blue from me to every 
sea,
This song for mariners and all their ships.






TO FOREIGN LANDS.

I HEARD that you ask'd for something to prove this puzzle the New 
World,
And to define America, her athletic Democracy,
Therefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you 
wanted.


TO A HISTORIAN.

YOU who celebrate bygones,
Who have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races, the life 
that has exhibited itself,
Who have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates, 
rulers and priests,
I, habitan of the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is in himself 
in his own rights,
Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself, (the 
great pride of man in himself,)
Chanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be,
I project the history of the future.


TO THEE OLD CAUSE.

TO thee old cause!
Thou peerless, passionate, good cause,
Thou stern, remorseless, sweet idea,
Deathless throughout the ages, races, lands,
After a strange sad war, great war for thee,
(I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be 
really fought, for thee,)
These chants for thee, the eternal march of thee.

(A war O soldiers not for itself alone,
Far, far more stood silently waiting behind, now to advance in 
this book.)

Thou orb of many orbs!
Thou seething principle! thou wellkept, latent germ! thou centre!
Around the idea of thee the war revolving,
With all its angry and vehement play of causes,
(With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years,)
These recitatives for thee,—my book and the war are one,
Merged in its spirit I and mine, as the contest hinged on thee,
As a wheel on its axis turns, this book unwitting to itself,
Around the idea of thee.





EIDÓLONS.

   I MET a seer,
Passing the hues and objects of the world,
The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,
   To glean eidólons.

   Put in thy chants said he,
No more the puzzling hour nor day, nor segments, parts, put in,
Put first before the rest as light for all and entrancesong of all,
   That of eidólons.

   Ever the dim beginning,
Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle,
Ever the summit and the merge at last, (to surely start again,)
   Eidólons! eidólons!

   Ever the mutable,
Ever materials, changing, crumbling, recohering,
Ever the ateliers, the factories divine,
   Issuing eidólons.

   Lo, I or you,
Or woman, man, or state, known or unknown,
We seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty build,
    But really build eidólons.

   The ostent evanescent,
The substance of an artist's mood or savan's studies long,
Or warrior's, martyr's, hero's toils,
   To fashion his eidólon.

   Of every human life,
(The units gather'd, posted, not a thought, emotion, deed, left out,)
The whole or large or small summ'd, added up,
   In its eidólon.

   The old, old urge,
Based on the ancient pinnacles, lo, newer, higher pinnacles,
From science and the modern still impell'd,
   The old, old urge, eidólons.

   The present now and here,
America's busy, teeming, intricate whirl,
Of aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing,
   Today's eidólons.




   These with the past,
Of vanish'd lands, of all the reigns of kings across the sea,
Old conquerors, old campaigns, old sailors' voyages,
   Joining eidólons.

   Densities, growth, façades,
Strata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees,
Farborn, fardying, living long, to leave,
   Eidólons everlasting.

   Exaltè, rapt, ecstatic,
The visible but their womb of birth,
Of orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape,
   The mighty eartheidólon.

   All space, all time,
(The stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns,
Swelling, collapsing, ending, serving their longer, shorter use,)
   Fill'd with eidólons only.

   The noiseless myriads,
The infinite oceans where the rivers empty,
The separate countless free identities, like eyesight,
   The true realities, eidólons.

   Not this the world,
Nor these the universes, they the universes,
Purport and end, ever the permanent life of life,
   Eidólons, eidólons.

   Beyond thy lectures learn'd professor,
Beyond thy telescope or spectroscope observer keen, beyond all 
mathematics,
Beyond the doctor's surgery, anatomy, beyond the chemist with 
his chemistry,
   The entities of entities, eidólons.

   Unfix'd yet fix'd,
Ever shall be, ever have been and are,
Sweeping the present to the infinite future,
   Eidólons, eidólons, eidólons.

   The prophet and the bard,
Shall yet maintain themselves, in higher stages yet,
Shall mediate to the Modern, to Democracy, interpret yet to them,
   God and eidólons.



   And thee my soul,
Joys, ceaseless exercises, exaltations,
Thy yearning amply fed at last, prepared to meet,
   Thy mates, eidólons.

   Thy body permanent,
The body lurking there within thy body,
The only purport of the form thou art, the real I myself,
   An image, an eidólon.

   Thy very songs not in thy songs,
No special strains to sing, none for itself,
But from the whole resulting, rising at last and floating,
   A round fullorb'd eidólon.


FOR HIM I SING.

FOR him I sing,
I raise the present on the past,
(As some perennial tree out of its roots, the present on the past,)
With time and space I him dilate and fuse the immortal laws,
To make himself by them the law unto himself.


WHEN I READ THE BOOK.

WHEN I read the book, the biography famous,
And is this then (said I) what the author calls a man's life?
And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life?
(As if any man really knew aught of my life,
Why even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real 
life,
Only a few hints, a few diffused faint clews and indirections
I seek for my own use to trace out here.)


BEGINNING MY STUDIES.

BEGINNING my studies the first step pleas'd me so much,
The mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,
The least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,
The first step I say awed me and pleas'd me so much,
I have hardly gone and hardly wish'd to go any farther,
But stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.





BEGINNERS.

HOW they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at inter
vals,)
How dear and dreadful they are to the earth,
How they inure to themselves as much as to any—what a paradox 
appears their age,
How people respond to them, yet know them not,
How there is something relentless in their fate all times,
How all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and re
ward,
And how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same 
great purchase.


TO THE STATES.

TO the States or any one of them, or any city of the States, Resist 
much, obey little,
Once unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved,
Once fully enslaved, no nation, state, city of this earth, ever after
ward resumes its liberty.


ON JOURNEYS THROUGH THE STATES.

ON journeys through the States we start,
(Ay through the world, urged by these songs,
Sailing henceforth to every land, to every sea,)
We willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all.

We have watch'd the seasons dispensing themselves and passing 
on,
And have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as 
the seasons, and effuse as much?

We dwell a while in every city and town,
We pass through Kanada, the Northeast, the vast valley of the 
Mississippi, and the Southern States,
We confer on equal terms with each of the States,
We make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear,
We say to ourselves, Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the 
body and the soul,
Dwell a while and pass on, be copious, temperate, chaste, mag
netic,
And what you effuse may then return as the seasons return,
And may be just as much as the seasons.





TO A CERTAIN CANTATRICE.

HERE, take this gift,
I was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or general,
One who should serve the good old cause, the great idea, the prog
ress and freedom of the race,
Some brave confronter of despots, some daring rebel;
But I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as 
to any.


ME IMPERTURBE.

ME imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,
Master of all or mistress of all, aplomb in the midst of irrational 
things,
Imbued as they, passive, receptive, silent as they,
Finding my occupation, poverty, notoriety, foibles, crimes, less im
portant than I thought,
Me toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or the Tennes
see, or far north or inland,
A river man, or a man of the woods or of any farmlife of these 
States or of the coast, or the lakes or Kanada,
Me wherever my life is lived, O to be selfbalanced for contingen
cies,
To confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as 
the trees and animals do.


SAVANTISM.

THITHER as I look I see each result and glory retracing itself and 
nestling close, always obligated,
Thither hours, months, years—thither trades, compacts, establish
ments, even the most minute,
Thither everyday life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates;
Thither we also, I with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant,
As a father to his father going takes his children along with him.


THE SHIP STARTING.

LO, the unbounded sea,
On its breast a ship starting, spreading all sails, carrying even her 
moonsails,
The pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so stately—
below emulous waves press forward,
They surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam.




I HEAR AMERICA SINGING.

I HEAR America singing, the varied carols I hear,
Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe 
and strong,
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off 
work,
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deck
hand singing on the steamboat deck,
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing 
as he stands,
The woodcutter's song, the ploughboy's on his way in the morn
ing, or at noon intermission or at sundown,
The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work,
or of the girl sewing or washing,
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,
The day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young 
fellows, robust, friendly,
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.


WHAT PLACE IS BESIEGED?

WHAT place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?
Lo, I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal,
And with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery,
And artillerymen, the deadliest that ever fired gun.


STILL THOUGH THE ONE I SING.

STILL though the one I sing,
(One, yet of contradictions made,) I dedicate to Nationality,
I leave in him revolt, (O latent right of insurrection! O quench
less, indispensable fire!)


SHUT NOT YOUR DOORS.

SHUT not your doors to me proud libraries,
For that which was lacking on all your wellfill'd shelves, yet 
needed most, I bring,
Forth from the war emerging, a book I have made,
The words of my book nothing, the drift of it every thing,
A book separate, not link'd with the rest nor felt by the intellect,
But you ye untold latencies will thrill to every page.




POETS TO COME.

POETS to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!
Not today is to justify me and answer what I am for,
But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than 
before known,
Arouse! for you must justify me.

I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future,
I but advance a moment only to wheel and hurry back in the 
darkness.

I am a man who, sauntering along without fully stopping, turns a 
casual look upon you and then averts his face,
Leaving it to you to prove and define it,
Expecting the main things from you.


TO YOU.

STRANGER, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why 
should you not speak to me?
And why should I not speak to you?


THOU READER.

THOU reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I,
Therefore for thee the following chants.

STARTING FROM PAUMANOK.



STARTING from fishshape Paumanok where I was born,
Wellbegotten, and rais'd by a perfect mother,
After roaming many lands, lover of populous pavements,
Dweller in Mannahatta my city, or on southern savannas,
Or a soldier camp'd or carrying my knapsack and gun, or a miner 
in California,
Or rude in my home in Dakota's woods, my diet meat, my drink 
from the spring,
Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,
Far from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and happy,



Aware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri, aware of mighty 
Niagara,
Aware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains, the hirsute and 
strongbreasted bull,
Of earth, rocks, Fifthmonth flowers experienced, stars, rain, snow,
my amaze,
Having studied the mockingbird's tones and the flight of the 
mountainhawk,
And heard at dawn the unrivall'd one, the hermit thrush from the 
swampcedars,
Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World.




Victory, union, faith, identity, time,
The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,
Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports.

This then is life,
Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and 
convulsions.

How curious! how real!
Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun.

See revolving the globe,
The ancestorcontinents away group'd together,
The present and future continents north and south, with the 
isthmus between.

See, vast trackless spaces,
As in a dream they change, they swiftly fill,
Countless masses debouch upon them,
They are now cover'd with the foremost people, arts, institutions,
known.

See, projected through time,
For me an audience interminable.

With firm and regular step they wend, they never stop,
Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions,
One generation playing its part and passing on,
Another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn,
With faces turn'd sideways or backward towards me to listen,
With eyes retrospective towards me.






Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian!
Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!
For you a programme of chants.

Chants of the prairies,
Chants of the longrunning Mississippi, and down to the Mexican 
sea,
Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota,
Chants going forth from the centre from Kansas, and thence equi
distant,
Shooting in pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all.




Take my leaves America, take them South and take them North,
Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own off
spring,
Surround them East and West, for they would surround you,
And you precedents, connect lovingly with them, for they connect 
lovingly with you.

I conn'd old times,
I sat studying at the feet of the great masters,
Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.

In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique?
Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.




Dead poets, philosophs, priests,
Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,
Languageshapers on other shores,
Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,
I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left 
wafted hither,
I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it,)
Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more 
than it deserves,
Regarding it all intently a long while, then dismissing it,
I stand in my place with my own day here.

Here lands female and male,
Here the heirship and heiressship of the world, here the flame of 
materials,



Here spirituality the translatress, the openlyavow'd,
The evertending, the finalè of visible forms,
The satisfier, after due longwaiting now advancing,
Yes here comes my mistress the soul.




The soul,
Forever and forever—longer than soil is brown and solid—longer 
than water ebbs and flows.

I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the 
most spiritual poems,
And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,
For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul 
and of immortality.

I will make a song for these States that no one State may under 
any circumstances be subjected to another State,
And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by 
night between all the States, and between any two of them,
And I will make a song for the ears of the President, full of weap
ons with menacing points,
And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces;
And a song make I of the One form'd out of all,
The fang'd and glittering One whose head is over all,
Resolute warlike One including and over all,
(However high the head of any else that head is over all.)

I will acknowledge contemporary lands,
I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute courte
ously every city large and small,
And employments! I will put in my poems that with you is hero
ism upon land and sea,
And I will report all heroism from an American point of view.

I will sing the song of companionship,
I will show what alone must finally compact these,
I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love, indi
cating it in me,
I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were 
threatening to consume me,
I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires,
I will give them complete abandonment,
I will write the evangelpoem of comrades and of love,
For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and joy?
And who but I should be the poet of comrades?






I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races,
I advance from the people in their own spirit,
Here is what sings unrestricted faith.

Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may,
I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also,
I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is—and I 
say there is in fact no evil,
(Or if there is I say it is just as important to you, to the land or 
to me, as any thing else.)

I too, following many and follow'd by many, inaugurate a religion,
I descend into the arena,
(It may be I am destin'd to utter the loudest cries there, the win
ner's pealing shouts,
Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above every thing.)

Each is not for its own sake,
I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion's 
sake.

I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,
None has ever yet adored or worship'd half enough,
None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how cer
tain the future is.

I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must 
be their religion,
Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur;
(Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion,
Nor land nor man or woman without religion.)




What are you doing young man?
Are you so earnest, so given up to literature, science, art, amours?
These ostensible realities, politics, points?
Your ambition or business whatever it may be?

It is well—against such I say not a word, I am their poet also,
But behold! such swiftly subside, burnt up for religion's sake,
For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential 
life of the earth,
Any more than such are to religion.





What do you seek so pensive and silent?
What do you need camerado?
Dear son do you think it is love?

Listen dear son—listen America, daughter or son,
It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess, and yet it 
satisfies, it is great,
But there is something else very great, it makes the whole coin
cide,
It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands sweeps 
and provides for all.




Know you, solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater 
religion,
The following chants each for its kind I sing.

My comrade!
For you to share with me two greatnesses, and a third one rising 
inclusive and more resplendent,
The greatness of Love and Democracy, and the greatness of Reli
gion.

Melange mine own, the unseen and the seen,
Mysterious ocean where the streams empty,
Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me,
Living beings, identities now doubtless near us in the air that we 
know not of,
Contact daily and hourly that will not release me,
These selecting, these in hints demanded of me.

Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me,
Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him,
Any more than I am held to the heavens and all the spiritual 
world,
After what they have done to me, suggesting themes.

O such themes—equalities! O divine average!
Warblings under the sun, usher'd as now, or at noon, or set
ing,
Strains musical flowing through ages, now reaching hither,
I take to your reckless and composite chords, add to them, and 
cheerfully pass them forward.






As I have walk'd in Alabama my morning walk,
I have seen where the shebird the mockingbird sat on her nest 
in the briers hatching her brood.

I have seen the hebird also,
I have paus'd to hear him near at hand inflating his throat and 
joyfully singing.

And while I paus'd it came to me that what he really sang for was 
not there only,
Nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes,
But subtle, clandestine, away beyond,
A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born.




Democracy! near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself 
and joyfully singing.

Ma femme! for the brood beyond us and of us,
For those who belong here and those to come,
I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger 
and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.

I will make the songs of passion to give them their way,
And your songs outlaw'd offenders, for I scan you with kindred 
eyes, and carry you with me the same as any.

I will make the true poem of riches,
To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes 
forward and is not dropt by death;
I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all, and I will be the 
bard of personality,
And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal 
of the other,
And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me, for I am 
determin'd to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove 
you illustrious,
And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present, and 
can be none in the future,
And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be 
turn'd to beautiful results,
And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than 
death,



And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events 
are compact,
And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each 
as profound as any.

I will not make poems with reference to parts,
But I will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to ensemble,
And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to 
all days,
And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but has 
reference to the soul,
Because having look'd at the objects of the universe, I find there 
is no one nor any particle of one but has reference to the 
soul.




Was somebody asking to see the soul?
See, your own shape and countenance, persons, substances, beasts,
the trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands.

All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them;
How can the real body ever die and be buried?

Of your real body and any man's or woman's real body,
Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpsecleaners and 
pass to fitting spheres,
Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the 
moment of death.

Not the types set up by the printer return their impression, the 
meaning, the main concern,
Any more than a man's substance and life or a woman's substance 
and life return in the body and the soul,
Indifferently before death and after death.

Behold, the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern,
and includes and is the soul;
Whoever you are, how superb and how divine is your body, or any 
part of it!




Whoever you are, to you endless announcements!

Daughter of the lands did you wait for your poet?
Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand?



Toward the male of the States, and toward the female of the States,
Exulting words, words to Democracy's lands.

Interlink'd, foodyielding lands!
Land of coal and iron! land of gold! land of cotton, sugar, rice!
Land of wheat, beef, pork! land of wool and hemp! land of the 
apple and the grape!
Land of the pastoral plains, the grassfields of the world! land of 
those sweetair'd interminable plateaus!
Land of the herd, the garden, the healthy house of adobie!
Lands where the northwest Columbia winds, and where the south
west Colorado winds!
Land of the eastern Chesapeake! land of the Delaware!
Land of Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan!
Land of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! land of Vermont 
and Connecticut!
Land of the ocean shores! land of sierras and peaks!
Land of boatmen and sailors! fishermen's land!
Inextricable lands! the clutch'd together! the passionate ones!
The side by side! the elder and younger brothers! the bony
limb'd!
The great women's land! the feminine! the experienced sisters 
and the inexperienced sisters!
Far breath'd land! Arctic braced! Mexican breez'd! the diverse!
the compact!
The Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Carolinian!
O all and each wellloved by me! my intrepid nations! O I at 
any rate include you all with perfect love!
I cannot be discharged from you! not from one any sooner than 
another!
O death! O for all that, I am yet of you unseen this hour with 
irrepressible love,
Walking New England, a friend, a traveler,
Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples on Pau
manok's sands,
Crossing the prairies, dwelling again in Chicago, dwelling in every 
town,
Observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,
Listening to orators and oratresses in public halls,
Of and through the States as during life, each man and woman 
my neighbor,
The Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to me, and I as near to 
him and her,
The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me, and I yet with any 
of them,



Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river, yet in my house of 
adobie,
Yet returning eastward, yet in the Seaside State or in Maryland,
Yet Kanadian cheerily braving the winter, the snow and ice wel
come to me,
Yet a true son either of Maine or of the Granite State, or the 
Narragansett Bay State, or the Empire State,
Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same, yet welcoming every 
new brother,
Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones from the hour they 
unite with the old ones,
Coming among the new ones myself to be their companion and 
equal, coming personally to you now,
Enjoining you to acts, characters, spectacles, with me.




With me with firm holding, yet haste, haste on.

For your life adhere to me,
(I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give 
myself really to you, but what of that?
Must not Nature be persuaded many times?)

No dainty dolce affettuoso I,
Bearded, sunburnt, grayneck'd, forbidding, I have arrived,
To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe,
For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.




On my way a moment I pause,
Here for you! and here for America!
Still the present I raise aloft, still the future of the States I 
harbinge glad and sublime,
And for the past I pronounce what the air holds of the red 
aborigines.

The red aborigines,
Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, calls as of birds 
and animals in the woods, syllabled to us for names,
Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez, Chatta
hoochee, Kaqueta, Oronoco,
Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, WallaWalla,
Leaving such to the States they melt, they depart, charging the 
water and the land with names.







Expanding and swift, henceforth,
Elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick and audacious,
A world primal again, vistas of glory incessant and branching,
A new race dominating previous ones and grander far, with new 
contests,
New politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts.

These, my voice announcing—I will sleep no more but arise,
You oceans that have been calm within me! how I feel you, fathom
less, stirring, preparing unprecedented waves and storms.




See, steamers steaming through my poems,
See, in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing,
See, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter's hut, the flatboat,
the maizeleaf, the claim, the rude fence, and the backwoods 
village,
See, on the one side the Western Sea and on the other the Eastern 
Sea, how they advance and retreat upon my poems as upon 
their own shores,
See, pastures and forests in my poems—see, animals wild and 
tame—see, beyond the Kaw, countless herds of buffalo 
feeding on short curly grass,
See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets,
with iron and stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and com
merce,
See, the manycylinder'd steam printingpress—see, the electric 
telegraph stretching across the continent,
See, through Atlantica's depths pulses American Europe reaching,
pulses of Europe duly return'd,
See, the strong and quick locomotive as it departs, panting, blowing 
the steamwhistle,
See, ploughmen ploughing farms—see, miners digging mines—
see, the numberless factories,
See, mechanics busy at their benches with tools—see from among 
them superior judges, philosophs, Presidents, emerge, drest 
in working dresses,
See, lounging through the shops and fields of the States, me well
belov'd, closeheld by day and night,
Hear the loud echoes of my songs there—read the hints come at 
last.




O camerado close! O you and me at last, and us two only.







O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly!
O something ecstatic and undemonstrable! O music wild!
O now I triumph—and you shall also;
O hand in hand—O wholesome pleasure—O one more desirer 
and lover!
O to haste firm holding—to haste, haste on with me.



SONG OF MYSELF.



I CELEBRATE myself, and sing myself,
And what I assume you shall assume,
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.

I loafe and invite my soul,
I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.

My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this 
air,
Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their 
parents the same,
I, now thirtyseven years old in perfect health begin,
Hoping to cease not till death.

Creeds and schools in abeyance,
Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,
I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,
Nature without check with original energy.




Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded 
with perfumes,
I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,
The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.

The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation,
it is odorless,
It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,
I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and 
naked,
I am mad for it to be in contact with me.




The smoke of my own breath,
Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, loveroot, silkthread, crotch and 
vine,
My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the pass
ing of blood and air through my lungs,
The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and 
darkcolor'd searocks, and of hay in the barn,
The sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the eddies 
of the wind,
A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,
The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs 
wag,
The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields 
and hillsides,
The feeling of health, the fullnoon trill, the song of me rising from 
bed and meeting the sun.

Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd 
the earth much?
Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?

Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin 
of all poems,
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions 
of suns left,)
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look 
through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in 
books,
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.




I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the begin
ning and the end,
But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.

There was never any more inception than there is now,
Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.

Urge and urge and urge,
Always the procreant urge of the world.





Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and 
increase, always sex,
Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.

To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is so.

Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied,
braced in the beams,
Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,
I and this mystery here we stand.

Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not 
my soul.

Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,
Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.

Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,
Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they 
discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.

Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man 
hearty and clean,
Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be 
less familiar than the rest.

I am satisfied—I see, dance, laugh, sing;
As the hugging and loving bedfellow sleeps at my side through 
the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with 
stealthy tread,
Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the house 
with their plenty,
Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my 
eyes,
That they turn from gazing after and down the road,
And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,
Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which 
is ahead?




Trippers and askers surround me,
People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward 
and city I live in, or the nation,
The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and 
new,



My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,
The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,
The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or illdoing or loss or 
lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,
Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news,
the fitful events;
These come to me days and nights and go from me again,
But they are not the Me myself.

Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,
Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,
Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain 
rest,
Looking with sidecurved head curious what will come next,
Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.

Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with 
linguists and contenders,
I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.




I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,
And you must not be abased to the other.

Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,
Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not 
even the best,
Only the lull I like, the hum of your valvèd voice.

I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,
How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over 
upon me,
And parted the shirt from my bosombone, and plunged your 
tongue to my barestript heart,
And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my 
feet.

Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that 
pass all the argument of the earth,
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,
And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the 
women my sisters and lovers,
And that a kelson of the creation is love,
And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,




And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,
And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder, mullein 
and pokeweed.




A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;
How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any 
more than he.

I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green 
stuff woven.

Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,
A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,
Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may 
see and remark, and say Whose?

Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the 
vegetation.

Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,
And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,
Growing among black folks as among white,
Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I 
receive them the same.

And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.

Tenderly will I use you curling grass,
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,
It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,
It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon 
out of their mothers' laps,
And here you are the mothers' laps.

This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,
Darker than the colorless beards of old men,
Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.

O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,
And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for 
nothing.

I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and 
women,



And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken 
soon out of their laps.

What do you think has become of the young and old men?
And what do you think has become of the women and chil
dren?

They are alive and well somewhere,
The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,
And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the 
end to arrest it,
And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.

All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,
And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.




Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?
I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I 
know it.

I pass death with the dying and birth with the newwash'd babe,
and am not contain'd between my hat and boots,
And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,
The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.

I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,
I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and 
fathomless as myself,
(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)

Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,
For me those that have been boys and that love women,
For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be 
slighted,
For me the sweetheart and the old maid, for me mothers and the 
mothers of mothers,
For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,
For me children and the begetters of children.

Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,
I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,
And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be 
shaken away.




                                      





The little one sleeps in its cradle,
I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies 
with my hand.

The youngster and the redfaced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,
I peeringly view them from the top.

The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,
I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol 
has fallen.

The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of bootsoles, talk of the 
promenaders,
The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the 
clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,
The snowsleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snowballs,
The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,
The flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the 
hospital,
The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,
The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working 
his passage to the centre of the crowd,
The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,
What groans of overfed or halfstarv'd who fall sunstruck or in 
fits,
What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and 
give birth to babes,
What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls 
restrain'd by decorum,
Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances,
rejections with convex lips,
I mind them or the show or resonance of them—I come and I 
depart.




The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,
The dried grass of the harvesttime loads the slowdrawn wagon,
The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,
The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.

I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,
I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,
I jump from the crossbeams and seize the clover and timothy,
And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.




                                      





Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,
Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,
In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,
Kindling a fire and broiling the freshkill'd game,
Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by my 
side.

The Yankee clipper is under her skysails, she cuts the sparkle and 
scud,
My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from 
the deck.

The boatmen and clamdiggers arose early and stopt for me,
I tuck'd my trowserends in my boots and went and had a good 
time;
You should have been with us that day round the chowderkettle.

I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west,
the bride was a red girl,
Her father and his friends sat near crosslegged and dumbly 
smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick 
blankets hanging from their shoulders,
On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his 
luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his 
bride by the hand,
She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight 
locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to 
her feet.

The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,
I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,
Through the swung halfdoor of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and 
weak,
And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,
And brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and bruis'd 
feet,
And gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave him 
some coarse clean clothes,
And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,
And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;
He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass'd 
north,
I had him sit next me at table, my firelock lean'd in the corner.




                                      





Twentyeight young men bathe by the shore,
Twentyeight young men and all so friendly;
Twentyeight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.

She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,
She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.

Which of the young men does she like the best?
Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.

Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,
You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.

Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twentyninth bather,
The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.

The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from their 
long hair,
Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.

An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,
It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.

The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to 
the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,
They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bend
ing arch,
They do not think whom they souse with spray.




The butcherboy puts off his killingclothes, or sharpens his knife 
at the stall in the market,
I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and breakdown.

Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,
Each has his mainsledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in 
the fire.

From the cinderstrew'd threshold I follow their movements,
The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,
Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so 
sure,
They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.




                                      





The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags 
underneath on its tiedover chain,
The negro that drives the long dray of the stoneyard, steady and 
tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the stringpiece,
His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over 
his hipband,
His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his 
hat away from his forehead,
The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black 
of his polish'd and perfect limbs.

I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop 
there,
I go with the team also.

In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as 
forward sluing,
To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object miss
ing,
Absorbing all to myself and for this song.

Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade,
what is that you express in your eyes?
It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.

My tread scares the wooddrake and woodduck on my distant and 
daylong ramble,
They rise together, they slowly circle around.

I believe in those wing'd purposes,
And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,
And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,
And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something 
else,
And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty 
well to me,
And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.




The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,
Yahonk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,
The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,
Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.



                                      



The sharphoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the housesill,
the chickadee, the prairiedog,
The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,
The brood of the turkeyhen and she with her halfspread wings,
I see in them and myself the same old law.

The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,
They scorn the best I can do to relate them.

I am enamour'd of growing outdoors,
Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,
Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and 
mauls, and the drivers of horses,
I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.

What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,
Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,
Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,
Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,
Scattering it freely forever.




The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,
The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles 
its wild ascending lisp,
The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanks
giving dinner,
The pilot seizes the kingpin, he heaves down with a strong arm,
The mate stands braced in the whaleboat, lance and harpoon are 
ready,
The duckshooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,
The deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the altar,
The spinninggirl retreats and advances to the hum of the big 
wheel,
The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a Firstday loafe and 
looks at the oats and rye,
The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,
(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother's 
bedroom;)
The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,
He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manu
script;
The malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,
What is removed drops horribly in a pail;


                                      



The quadroon girl is sold at the auctionstand, the drunkard nods 
by the barroom stove,
The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat,
the gatekeeper marks who pass,
The young fellow drives the expresswagon, (I love him, though 
I do not know him;)
The halfbreed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,
The western turkeyshooting draws old and young, some lean on 
their rifles, some sit on logs,
Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels 
his piece;
The groups of newlycome immigrants cover the wharf or levee,
As the woollypates hoe in the sugarfield, the overseer views them 
from his saddle,
The bugle calls in the ballroom, the gentlemen run for their part
ners, the dancers bow to each other,
The youth lies awake in the cedarroof'd garret and harks to the 
musical rain,
The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,
The squaw wrapt in her yellowhemm'd cloth is offering moccasins 
and beadbags for sale,
The connoisseur peers along the exhibitiongallery with halfshut 
eyes bent sideways,
As the deckhands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for 
the shoregoing passengers,
The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it 
off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots,
The oneyear wife is recovering and happy having a week ago 
borne her first child,
The cleanhair'd Yankee girl works with her sewingmachine or in 
the factory or mill,
The pavingman leans on his twohanded rammer, the reporter's 
lead flies swiftly over the notebook, the signpainter is 
lettering with blue and gold,
The canal boy trots on the towpath, the bookkeeper counts at 
his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,
The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers 
follow him,
The child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,
The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the 
white sails sparkle!)
The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would 
stray,
The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser hig
gling about the odd cent;)


                                      



The bride unrumples her white dress, the minutehand of the clock 
moves slowly,
The opiumeater reclines with rigid head and justopen'd lips,
The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy 
and pimpled neck,
The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink 
to each other,
(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)
The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great 
Secretaries,
On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined 
arms,
The crew of the fishsmack pack repeated layers of halibut in the 
hold,
The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,
As the farecollector goes through the train he gives notice by the 
jingling of loose change,
The floormen are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof,
the masons are calling for mortar,
In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;
Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather'd,
it is the fourth of Seventhmonth, (what salutes of cannon 
and small arms!)
Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower 
mows, and the wintergrain falls in the ground;
Off on the lakes the pikefisher watches and waits by the hole in 
the frozen surface,
The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes 
deep with his axe,
Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cottonwood or 
pecantrees,
Coonseekers go through the regions of the Red river or through 
those drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of the 
Arkansas,
Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or 
Altamahaw,
Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and greatgrand
sons around them,
In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after 
their day's sport,
The city sleeps and the country sleeps,
The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,
The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps 
by his wife;
And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,


                                      



And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,
And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.




I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,
Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,
Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,
Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff that 
is fine,
One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the 
largest the same,
A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and 
hospitable down by the Oconee I live,
A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the 
limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on 
earth,
A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deerskin 
leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,
A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger,
Buckeye;
At home on Kanadian snowshoes or up in the bush, or with 
fishermen off Newfoundland,
At home in the fleet of iceboats, sailing with the rest and tack
ing,
At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the 
Texan ranch,
Comrade of Californians, comrade of free NorthWesterners, (lov
ing their big proportions,)
Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake 
hands and welcome to drink and meat,
A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,
A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,
Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,
A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,
Prisoner, fancyman, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.

I resist any thing better than my own diversity,
Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,
And am not stuck up, and am in my place.

(The moth and the fisheggs are in their place,
The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their 
place,
The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)




                                      





These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they 
are not original with me,
If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next 
to nothing,
If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are 
nothing,
If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.

This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,
This the common air that bathes the globe.




With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,
I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for 
conquer'd and slain persons.

Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?
I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in 
which they are won.

I beat and pound for the dead,
I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.

Vivas to those who have fail'd!
And to those whose warvessels sank in the sea!
And to those themselves who sank in the sea!
And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!
And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes 
known!




This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,
It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make appoint
ments with all,
I will not have a single person slighted or left away,
The keptwoman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,
The heavylipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;
There shall be no difference between them and the rest.

This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,
This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,
This the faroff depth and height reflecting my own face,
This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.



                                      



Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?
Well I have, for the Fourthmonth showers have, and the mica on 
the side of a rock has.

Do you take it I would astonish?
Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering 
through the woods?
Do I astonish more than they?

This hour I tell things in confidence,
I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.




Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;
How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?

What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?

All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,
Else it were time lost listening to me.

I do not snivel that snivel the world over,
That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.

Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, con
formity goes to the fourthremov'd,
I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.

Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?

Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd with 
doctors and calculated close,
I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.

In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barleycorn 
less,
And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.

I know I am solid and sound,
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,
All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.

I know I am deathless,
I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's 
compass,


                                      



I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt 
stick at night.

I know I am august,
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,
I see that the elementary laws never apologize,
(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by,
after all.)

I exist as I am, that is enough,
If no other in the world be aware I sit content,
And if each and all be aware I sit content.

One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is my
self,
And whether I come to my own today or in ten thousand or ten 
million years,
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.

My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,
I laugh at what you call dissolution,
And I know the amplitude of time.




I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,
The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are 
with me,
The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate 
into a new tongue.

I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,
And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,
And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.

I chant the chant of dilation or pride,
We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,
I show that size is only development.

Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?
It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still 
pass on.

I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,
I call to the earth and sea halfheld by the night.



                                      



Press close barebosom'd night—press close magnetic nourishing 
night!
Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!
Still nodding night—mad naked summer night.

Smile O voluptuous coolbreath'd earth!
Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!
Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains mistytopt!
Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!
Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!
Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my 
sake!
Farswooping elbow'd earth—rich appleblossom'd earth!
Smile, for your lover comes.

Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I to you give love!
O unspeakable passionate love.




You sea! I resign myself to you also—I guess what you mean,
I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,
I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,
We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of 
the land,
Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,
Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.

Sea of stretch'd groundswells,
Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,
Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell'd yet alwaysready graves,
Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,
I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.

Partaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation,
Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others' arms.

I am he attesting sympathy,
(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house 
that supports them?)

I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the 
poet of wickedness also.

What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?
Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,


                                      



My gait is no faultfinder's or rejecter's gait,
I moisten the roots of all that has grown.

Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?
Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd over and 
rectified?

I find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,
Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,
Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.

This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,
There is no better than it and now.

What behaved well in the past or behaves well today is not such a 
wonder,
The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man 
or an infidel.




Endless unfolding of words of ages!
And mine a word of the modern, the word EnMasse.

A word of the faith that never balks,
Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time abso
lutely.

It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,
That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.

I accept Reality and dare not question it,
Materialism first and last imbuing.

Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!
Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,
This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar 
of the old cartouches,
These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.
This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a 
mathematician.

Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!
Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,
I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.



                                      



Less the reminders of properties told my words,
And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and 
extrication,
And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men 
and women fully equipt,
And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that 
plot and conspire.




Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,
Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,
No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from 
them,
No more modest than immodest.

Unscrew the locks from the doors!
Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!

Whoever degrades another degrades me,
And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.

Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the cur
rent and index.

I speak the password primeval, I give the sign of democracy,
By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their coun
terpart of on the same terms.

Through me many long dumb voices,
Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,
Voices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,
Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,
And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of 
the fatherstuff,
And of the rights of them the others are down upon,
Of the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,
Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.

Through me forbidden voices,
Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,
Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.

I do not press my fingers across my mouth,
I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,
Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.



                                      



I believe in the flesh and the appetites,
Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me 
is a miracle.

Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or 
am touch'd from,
The scent of these armpits aroma finer than prayer,
This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.

If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of 
my own body, or any part of it,
Translucent mould of me it shall be you!
Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!
Firm masculine colter it shall be you!
Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!
You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!
My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!
Root of wash'd sweetflag! timorous pondsnipe! nest of guarded 
duplicate eggs! it shall be you!
Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!
Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!
Sun so generous it shall be you!
Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!
You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!
Winds whose softtickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!
Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my 
winding paths, it shall be you!
Hands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever 
touch'd, it shall be you.

I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,
Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,
I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my 
faintest wish,
Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friend
ship I take again.

That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,
A morningglory at my window satisfies me more than the meta
physics of books.

To behold the daybreak!
The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,
The air tastes good to my palate.



                                      



Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising 
freshly exuding,
Scooting obliquely high and low.

Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,
Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.

The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,
The heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,
The mocking taunt. See then whether you shall be master!




Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sunrise would kill me,
If I could not now and always send sunrise out of me.

We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,
We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the day
break.

My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,
With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of 
worlds.

Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,
It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,
Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?

Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of 
articulation,
Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?
Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,
The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,
I underlying causes to balance them at last,
My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of 
all things,
Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in 
search of this day.)

My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really 
am,
Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,
I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.

Writing and talk do not prove me,
I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,
With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.




                                      





Now I will do nothing but listen,
To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute 
toward it.

I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames,
clack of sticks cooking my meals,
I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,
I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,
Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day 
and night,
Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of 
workpeople at their meals,
The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,
The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronoun
cing a deathsentence,
The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the 
refrain of the anchorlifters,
The ring of alarmbells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swiftstreak
ing engines and hosecarts with premonitory tinkles and 
color'd lights,
The steamwhistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,
The slow march play'd at the head of the association marching 
two and two,
(They go to guard some corpse, the flagtops are draped with 
black muslin.)

I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)
I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,
It shakes madsweet pangs through my belly and breast.

I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,
Ah this indeed is music—this suits me.

A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,
The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.

I hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)
The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,
It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd 
them,
It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent 
waves,
I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,


                                      



Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes 
of death,
At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,
And that we call Being.




To be in any form, what is that?
(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)
If nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell were 
enough.

Mine is no callous shell,
I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,
They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.

I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,
To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I can 
stand.




Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,
Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,
Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,
My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly 
different from myself,
On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,
Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,
Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,
Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,
Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,
Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture
fields,
Immodestly sliding the fellowsenses away,
They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges 
of me,
No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,
Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,
Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.

The sentries desert every other part of me,
They have left me helpless to a red marauder,
They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.

I am given up by traitors,
I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the 
greatest traitor,


                                      



I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me 
there.

You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its 
throat,
Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.




Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharptooth'd 
touch!
Did it make you ache so, leaving me?

Parting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,
Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.

Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,
Landscapes projected masculine, fullsized and golden.




All truths wait in all things,
They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,
They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,
The insignificant is as big to me as any,
(What is less or more than a touch?)

Logic and sermons never convince,
The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.

(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,
Only what nobody denies is so.)

A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,
I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,
And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,
And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each 
other,
And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it 
becomes omnific,
And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.




I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the stars,
And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the 
egg of the wren,


                                      



And the treetoad is a chefd'oeuvre for the highest,
And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,
And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,
And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue,
And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.

I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, longthreaded moss, fruits, grains,
esculent roots,
And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,
And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,
But call any thing back again when I desire it.

In vain the speeding or shyness,
In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,
In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd bones,
In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,
In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying 
low,
In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,
In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,
In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,
In vain the razorbill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,
I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.




I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and 
selfcontain'd,
I stand and look at them long and long.

They do not sweat and whine about their condition,
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of 
owning things,
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of 
years ago,
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.

So they show their relations to me and I accept them,
They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their 
possession.

I wonder where they get those tokens,
Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?



                                      



Myself moving forward then and now and forever,
Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,
Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,
Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,
Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly 
terms.

A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,
Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,
Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,
Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.

His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,
His wellbuilt limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and 
return.

I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,
Why do I need your paces when I myself outgallop them?
Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.




Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,
What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,
What I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,
And again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the 
morning.

My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in seagaps,
I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,
I am afoot with my vision.

By the city's quadrangular houses—in log huts, camping with 
lumbermen,
Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,
Weeding my onionpatch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips,
crossing savannas, trailing in forests,
Prospecting, golddigging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,
Scorch'd ankledeep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the 
shallow river,
Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where 
the buck turns furiously at the hunter,
Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the 
otter is feeding on fish,
Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,


                                      



Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the 
beaver pats the mud with his paddleshaped tail;
Over the growing sugar, over the yellowflower'd cotton plant, over 
the rice in its low moist field,
Over the sharppeak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum and 
slender shoots from the gutters,
Over the western persimmon, over the longleav'd corn, over the 
delicate blueflower flax,
Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there 
with the rest,
Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the 
breeze;
Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low 
scragged limbs,
Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of 
the brush,
Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheatlot,
Where the bat flies in the Seventhmonth eve, where the great gold
bug drops through the dark,
Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to 
the meadow,
Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shud
dering of their hides,
Where the cheesecloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons 
straddle the hearthslab, where cobwebs fall in festoons 
from the rafters;
Where triphammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,
Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its 
ribs,
Where the pearshaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it my
self and looking composedly down,)
Where the lifecar is drawn on the slipnoose, where the heat 
hatches palegreen eggs in the dented sand,
Where the shewhale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,
Where the steamship trails hindways its long pennant of smoke,
Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,
Where the halfburn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,
Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupt
ing below;
Where the densestarr'd flag is borne at the head of the regiments,
Approaching Manhattan up by the longstretching island,
Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,
Upon a doorstep, upon the horseblock of hard wood outside,
Upon the racecourse, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game 
of baseball,


                                      



At hefestivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bulldances,
drinking, laughter,
At the cidermill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking 
the juice through a straw,
At applepeelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,
At musters, beachparties, friendly bees, huskings, houseraisings;
Where the mockingbird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,
screams, weeps,
Where the hayrick stands in the barnyard, where the drystalks 
are scatter'd, where the broodcow waits in the hovel,
Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud 
to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,
Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short 
jerks,
Where sundown shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome 
prairie,
Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square 
miles far and near,
Where the hummingbird shimmers, where the neck of the long
lived swan is curving and winding,
Where the laughinggull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her 
nearhuman laugh,
Where beehives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by 
the high weeds,
Where bandneck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with 
their heads out,
Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,
Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,
Where the yellowcrown'd heron comes to the edge of the marsh 
at night and feeds upon small crabs,
Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,
Where the katydid works her chromatic reed on the walnuttree 
over the well,
Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silverwired leaves,
Through the saltlick or orange glade, or under conical firs,
Through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon, through the 
office or public hall;
Pleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd with 
the new and old,
Pleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,
Pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks 
melodiously,
Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,
Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preach
er, impress'd seriously at the campmeeting;


                                      



Looking in at the shopwindows of Broadway the whole forenoon,
flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,
Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the 
clouds, or down a lane or along the beach,
My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the 
middle;
Coming home with the silent and darkcheek'd bushboy, (behind 
me he rides at the drape of the day,)
Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet, or 
the moccasin print,
By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,
Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;
Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,
Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,
Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,
Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me 
a long while,
Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by 
my side,
Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,
Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the 
diameter of eighty thousand miles,
Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fireballs like the rest,
Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in 
its belly,
Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,
Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,
I tread day and night such roads.

I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,
And look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.

I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,
My course runs below the soundings of plummets.

I help myself to material and immaterial,
No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.

I anchor my ship for a little while only,
My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.

I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike
pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.

I ascend to the foretruck,


                                      



I take my place late at night in the crow'snest,
We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,
Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful 
beauty,
The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery 
is plain in all directions,
The whitetopt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my 
fancies toward them,
We are approaching some great battlefield in which we are soon 
to be engaged,
We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with 
still feet and caution,
Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,
The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities 
of the globe.

I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,
I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,
I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.

My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,
They fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.

I understand the large hearts of heroes,
The courage of present times and all times,
How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the 
steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,
How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faith 
ful of days and faithful of nights,
And chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will 
not desert you;
How he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days and 
would not give it up,
How he saved the drifting company at last,
How the lank loosegown'd women look'd when boated from the 
side of their prepared graves,
How the silent oldfaced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp
lipp'd unshaved men;
All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,
I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there.

The disdain and calmness of martyrs,
The mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry wood,
her children gazing on,
The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blow
ing, cover'd with sweat,


                                      



The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the mur
derous buckshot and the bullets,
All these I feel or am.

I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,
Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marks
men,
I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the 
ooze of my skin,
I fall on the weeds and stones,
The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,
Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with 
whipstocks.

Agonies are one of my changes of garments,
I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become 
the wounded person,
My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.

I am the mash'd fireman with breastbone broken,
Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,
Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my com
rades,
I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,
They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.

I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my 
sake,
Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,
White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared 
of their firecaps,
The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.

Distant and dead resuscitate,
They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock 
myself.

I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,
I am there again.

Again the long roll of the drummers,
Again the attacking cannon, mortars,
Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.

I take part, I see and hear the whole,


                                      



The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for wellaim'd shots,
The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,
Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,
The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fanshaped explo
sion,
The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.

Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves 
with his hand,
He gasps through the clot Mind not me—mind—the entrench 
ments.




Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,
(I tell not the fall of Alamo,
Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,
The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)
'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and 
twelve young men.

Retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their baggage 
for breastworks,
Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine times 
their number, was the price they took in advance,
Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,
They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing and 
seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners of war.

They were the glory of the race of rangers,
Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,
Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,
Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,
Not a single one over thirty years of age.

The second Firstday morning they were brought out in squads 
and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,
The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by eight.

None obey'd the command to kneel,
Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and 
straight,
A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead 
lay together,
The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the newcomers saw 
hem there,


                                      



Some halfkill'd attempted to crawl away,
These were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the blunts 
of muskets,
A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two more 
came to release him,
The three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.

At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;
That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve 
young men.




Would you hear of an oldtime seafight?
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it to me.

Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)
His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,
and never was, and never will be;
Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.

We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,
My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.

We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,
On our lowergundeck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,
killing all around and blowing up overhead.

Fighting at sundown, fighting at dark,
Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,
and five feet of water reported,
The masteratarms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterhold 
to give them a chance for themselves.

The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,
They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.

Our frigate takes fire,
The other asks if we demand quarter?
If our colors are struck and the fighting done?

Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,
We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our 
part of the fighting.



                                      



Only three guns are in use,
One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's main
mast,
Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry and 
clear his decks.

The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the 
maintop,
They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.

Not a moment's cease,
The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder
magazine.

One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we 
are sinking.

Serene stands the little captain,
He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,
His eyes give more light to us than our battlelanterns.

Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to 
us.




Stretch'd and still lies the midnight,
Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,
Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the 
one we have conquer'd,
The captain on the quarterdeck coldly giving his orders through 
a countenance white as a sheet,
Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,
The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully 
curl'd whiskers,
The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,
The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,
Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh 
upon the masts and spars,
Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of 
waves,
Black and impassive guns, litter of powderparcels, strong scent,
A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,
Delicate sniffs of seabreeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the 
shore, deathmessages given in charge to survivors,
The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,


                                      



Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long,
dull, tapering groan,
These so, these irretrievable.




You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!
In at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!
Embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,
See myself in prison shaped like another man,
And feel the dull unintermitted pain.

For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep 
watch,
It is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.

Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd to 
him and walk by his side,
(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat 
on my twitching lips.)

Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried 
and sentenced.

Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last 
gasp,
My face is ashcolor'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me people 
retreat.

Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,
I project my hat, sit shamefaced, and beg.




Enough! enough! enough!
Somehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!
Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers, dreams,
gaping,
I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.

That I could forget the mockers and insults!
That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludg
eons and hammers!
That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and 
bloody crowning.



                                      



I remember now,
I resume the overstaid fraction,
The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to 
any graves,
Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.

I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an average 
unending procession,
Inland and seacoast we go, and pass all boundary lines,
Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,
The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of 
years.

Eleves, I salute you! come forward!
Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.




The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?
Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?

Is he some Southwesterner rais'd outdoors? is he Kanadian?
Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?
The mountains? prairielife, bushlife? or sailor from the sea?

Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,
They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay 
with them.

Behavior lawless as snowflakes, words simple as grass, uncomb'd 
head, laughter, and naivetè,
Slowstepping feet, common features, common modes and ema
nations,
They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,
They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out 
of the glance of his eyes.




Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask—lie over!
You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.

Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,
Say, old topknot, what do you want?

Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,


                                      



And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,
And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and 
days.

Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,
When I give I give myself.

You there, impotent, loose in the knees,
Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,
Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,
I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,
And any thing I have I bestow.

I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,
You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.

To cottonfield drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,
On his right cheek I put the family kiss,
And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.

On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes,
(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)

To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door,
Turn the bedclothes toward the foot of the bed,
Let the physician and the priest go home.

I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,
O despairer, here is my neck,
By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.

I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,
Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,
Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.

Sleep—I and they keep guard all night,
Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,
I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,
And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.




I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,
And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.



                                      



I heard what was said of the universe,
Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;
It is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all?

Magnifying and applying come I,
Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,
Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,
Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,
Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,
In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix 
engraved,
With Odin and the hideousfaced Mexitli and every idol and image,
Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,
Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,
(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise and 
fly and sing for themselves,)
Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself,
bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,
Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,
Putting higher claims for him there with his roll'dup sleeves driving 
the mallet and chisel,
Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke 
or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any 
revelation,
Lads ahold of fireengines and hookandladder ropes no less to 
me than the gods of the antique wars,
Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,
Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their white 
foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;
By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for 
every person born,
Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels 
with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,
The snagtooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to 
come,
Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his 
brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;
What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about 
me, and not filling the square rod then,
The bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,
Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,
The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one 
of the supremes,
The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as 
the best, and be as prodigious;


                                      



By my lifelumps! becoming already a creator,
Putting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the shadows.




A call in the midst of the crowd,
My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.

Come my children,
Come my boys and girls, my women, household and intimates,
Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his prelude 
on the reeds within.

Easily written loosefinger'd chords—I feel the thrum of your 
climax and close.

My head slues round on my neck,
Music rolls, but not from the organ,
Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.

Ever the hard unsunk ground,
Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun,
ever the air and the ceaseless tides,
Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,
Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb, that 
breath of itches and thirsts,
Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides 
and bring him forth,
Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,
Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.

Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,
To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,
Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going.
Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for pay
ment receiving,
A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.

This is the city and I am one of the citizens,
Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets,
newspapers, schools,
The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks,
stores, real estate and personal estate.

The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail'd 
coats,


                                      



I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or fleas,)
I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest 
is deathless with me,
What I do and say the same waits for them,
Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.

I know perfectly well my own egotism,
Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,
And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.

Not words of routine this song of mine,
But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;
This printed and bound book—but the printer and the printing
office boy?
The welltaken photographs—but your wife or friend close and 
solid in your arms?
The black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets—
but the pluck of the captain and engineers?
In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture—but the host and 
hostess, and the look out of their eyes?
The sky up there—yet here or next door, or across the way?
The saints and sages in history—but you yourself?
Sermons, creeds, theology—but the fathomless human brain,
And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?




I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,
My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,
Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient 
and modern,
Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand 
years,
Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the 
sun,
Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in 
the circle of obis,
Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,
Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and 
austere in the woods a gymnosophist,
Drinking mead from the skullcup, to Shastas and Vedas admirant,
minding the Koran,
Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife,
beating the serpentskin drum,
Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing 
assuredly that he is divine,


                                      



To the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting 
patiently in a pew,
Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting deadlike till 
my spirit arouses me,
Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and 
land,
Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.

One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like a 
man leaving charges before a journey.

Downhearted doubters dull and excluded,
Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd, atheistical,
I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt,
despair and unbelief.

How the flukes splash!
How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of 
blood!

Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,
I take my place among you as much as among any,
The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,
And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely 
the same.

I do not know what is untried and afterward,
But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.

Each who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd, not 
a single one can it fail.

It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,
Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,
Nor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew back 
and was never seen again,
Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with 
bitterness worse than gall,
Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad dis
order,
Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish koboo 
call'd the ordure of humanity,
Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in,
Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the 
earth,


                                      



Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of 
myriads that inhabit them,
Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.




It is time to explain myself—let us stand up.

What is known I strip away,
I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.

The clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate?

We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,
There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.

Births have brought us richness and variety,
And other births will bring us richness and variety.

I do not call one greater and one smaller,
That which fills its period and place is equal to any.

Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my 
sister?
I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,
All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,
(What have I to do with lamentation?)

I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of things 
to be.

My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,
On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the 
steps,
All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.

Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,
Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,
I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,
And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.

Long I was hugg'd close—long and long.

Immense have been the preparations for me,
Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.



                                      



Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,
For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,
They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.

Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,
My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.

For it the nebula cohered to an orb,
The long slow strata piled to rest it on,
Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,
Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited 
it with care.

All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me,
Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.




O span of youth! everpush'd elasticity!
O manhood, balanced, florid and full.

My lovers suffocate me,
Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,
Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me 
at night,
Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and 
chirping over my head,
Calling my name from flowerbeds, vines, tangled underbrush,
Lighting on every moment of my life,
Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,
Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them 
to be mine.

Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying 
days!

Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows 
after and out of itself,
And the dark hush promulges as much as any.

I open my scuttle at night and see the farsprinkled systems,
And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim 
of the farther systems.

Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,
Outward and outward and forever outward.



                                      



My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,
He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,
And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.

There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,
If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,
were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would 
not avail in the long run,
We should surely bring up again where we now stand,
And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.

A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not 
hazard the span or make it impatient,
They are but parts, any thing is but a part.

See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,
Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.

My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,
The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,
The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there.




I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured 
and never will be measured.

I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)
My signs are a rainproof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from 
the woods,
No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,
I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,
I lead no man to a dinnertable, library, exchange,
But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,
My left hand hooking you round the waist,
My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public 
road.

Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,
You must travel it for yourself.

It is not far, it is within reach,
Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not 
know,
Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.



                                      



Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten 
forth,
Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.

If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand 
on my hip,
And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,
For after we start we never lie by again.

This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the crowded 
heaven,
And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those 
orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in 
them, shall we be fill'd and satisfied then?
And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue 
beyond.

You are also asking me questions and I hear you,
I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.

Sit a while dear son,
Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,
But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I 
kiss you with a goodby kiss and open the gate for your 
egress hence.

Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,
Now I wash the gum from your eyes,
You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every 
moment of your life.

Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,
Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,
To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout,
and laughingly dash with your hair.




I am the teacher of athletes,
He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the 
width of my own,
He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the 
teacher.

The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived 
power, but in his own right,


                                      



Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,
Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,
Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel 
cuts,
Firstrate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff, to 
sing a song or play on the banjo,
Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with smallpox 
over all latherers,
And those welltann'd to those that keep out of the sun.

I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?
I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,
My words itch at your ears till you understand them.

I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while I 
wait for a boat,
(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of 
you,
Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)

I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,
And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her 
who privately stays with me in the open air.

If you would understand me go to the heights or watershore,
The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves 
a key,
The maul, the oar, the handsaw, second my words.

No shutter'd room or school can commune with me,
But roughs and little children better than they.

The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,
The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me 
with him all day,
The farmboy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my 
voice,
In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen 
and love them.

The soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,
On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not 
fail them,
On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me 
seek me.



                                      



My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in his 
blanket,
The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,
The young mother and old mother comprehend me,
The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where 
they are,
They and all would resume what I have told them.




I have said that the soul is not more than the body,
And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,
And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,
And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own 
funeral drest in his shroud,
And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the 
earth,
And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds 
the learning of all times,
And there is no trade or employment but the young man following 
it may become a hero,
And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd 
universe,
And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and 
composed before a million universes.

And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,
For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,
(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God 
and about death.)

I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not 
in the least,
Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than 
myself.

Why should I wish to see God better than this day?
I see something of God each hour of the twentyfour, and each 
moment then,
In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in 
the glass,
I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign'd 
by God's name,
And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er I go,
Others will punctually come for ever and ever.




                                      





And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to 
try to alarm me.

To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,
I see the elderhand pressing receiving supporting,
I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,
And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.

And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does 
not offend me,
I smell the white roses sweetscented and growing,
I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of melons.

And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,
(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)

I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,
O suns—O grass of graves—O perpetual transfers and pro
motions,
If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?

Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,
Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,
Toss, sparkles of day and dusk—toss on the black stems that 
decay in the muck,
Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.

I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,
I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,
And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or 
small.




There is that in me—I do not know what it is—but I know it is 
in me.

Wrench'd and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes,
I sleep—I sleep long.

I do not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid,
It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.

Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,
To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.



                                      



Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers 
and sisters.

Do you see O my brothers and sisters?
It is not chaos or death—it is form, union, plan—it is eternal 
life—it is Happiness.




The past and present wilt—I have fill'd them, emptied them.
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.

Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute 
longer.)

Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the doorslab.

Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with 
his supper?
Who wishes to walk with me?

Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?




The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my 
gab and my loitering.

I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.

The last scud of day holds back for me,
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow'd 
wilds,
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.

I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,
I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.

I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,
If you want me again look for me under your bootsoles.



                                      



You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,
And filter and fibre your blood.

Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,
Missing me one place search another,
I stop somewhere waiting for you.



CHILDREN OF ADAM.


TO THE GARDEN THE WORLD

TO the garden the world anew ascending,
Potent mates, daughters, sons, preluding,
The love, the life of their bodies, meaning and being,
Curious here behold my resurrection after slumber,
The revolving cycles in their wide sweep having brought me again,
Amorous, mature, all beautiful to me, all wondrous,
My limbs and the quivering fire that ever plays through them, for 
reasons, most wondrous,
Existing I peer and penetrate still,
Content with the present, content with the past,
By my side or back of me Eve following,
Or in front, and I following her just the same.


FROM PENTUP ACHING RIVERS.

FROM pentup aching rivers,
From that of myself without which I were nothing,
From what I am determin'd to make illustrious, even if I stand 
sole among men,
From my own voice resonant, singing the phallus,
Singing the song of procreation,
Singing the need of superb children and therein superb grown 
people,
Singing the muscular urge and the blending,
Singing the bedfellow's song, (O resistless yearning!
O for any and each the body correlative attracting!


                                      



O for you whoever you are your correlative body! O it, more than 
all else, you delighting!)
From the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day,
From native moments, from bashful pains, singing them,
Seeking something yet unfound though I have diligently sought it 
many a long year,
Singing the true song of the soul fitful at random,
Renascent with grossest Nature or among animals,
Of that, of them and what goes with them my poems informing,
Of the smell of apples and lemons, of the pairing of birds,
Of the wet of woods, of the lapping of waves,
Of the mad pushes of waves upon the land, I them chanting,
The overture lightly sounding, the strain anticipating,
The welcome nearness, the sight of the perfect body,
The swimmer swimming naked in the bath, or motionless on his 
back lying and floating,
The female form approaching, I pensive, loveflesh tremulous 
aching,
The divine list for myself or you or for any one making,
The face, the limbs, the index from head to foot, and what it 
arouses,
The mystic deliria, the madness amorous, the utter abandonment,
(Hark close and still what I now whisper to you,
I love you, O you entirely possess me,
O that you and I escape from the rest and go utterly off, free and 
lawless,
Two hawks in the air, two fishes swimming in the sea not more 
lawless than we;)
The furious storm through me careering, I passionately trembling.
The oath of the inseparableness of two together, of the woman 
that loves me and whom I love more than my life, that oath 
swearing,
(O I willingly stake all for you,
O let me be lost if it must be so!
O you and I! what is it to us what the rest do or think?
What is all else to us? only that we enjoy each other and exhaust 
each other if it must be so;)
From the master, the pilot I yield the vessel to,
The general commanding me, commanding all, from him permis
sion taking,
From time the programme hastening, (I have loiter'd too long as 
it is,)
From sex, from the warp and from the woof,
From privacy, from frequent repinings alone,
From plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near,


                                      



From the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingers 
through my hair and beard,
From the long sustain'd kiss upon the mouth or bosom,
From the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk, fainting 
with excess,
From what the divine husband knows, from the work of fatherhood,
From exultation, victory and relief, from the bedfellow's embrace 
in the night,
From the actpoems of eyes, hands, hips and bosoms,
From the cling of the trembling arm,
From the bending curve and the clinch,
From side by side the pliant coverlet offthrowing,
From the one so unwilling to have me leave, and me just as un
willing to leave,
(Yet a moment O tender waiter, and I return,)
From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews,
From the night a moment I emerging flitting out,
Celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for,
And you stalwart loins.


I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC.



I SING the body electric,
The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the 
soul.
Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal 
themselves?
And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile 
the dead?
And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?
And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?




The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body 
itself balks account,
That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.
The expression of the face balks account,
But the expression of a wellmade man appears not only in his 
face,


                                      



It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his 
hips and wrists,
It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and 
knees, dress does not hide him,
The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and 
broadcloth,
To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,
You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoul
derside.
The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, 
the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, 
the contour of their shape downwards,
The swimmer naked in the swimmingbath, seen as he swims 
through the transparent greenshine, or lies with his face 
up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water,
The bending forward and backward of rowers in rowboats, the 
horseman in his saddle,
Girls, mothers, housekeepers, in all their performances,
The group of laborers seated at noontime with their open dinner
kettles, and their wives waiting,
The female soothing a child, the farmer's daughter in the garden 
or cowyard,
The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleighdriver driving his six 
horses through the crowd,
The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprenticeboys, quite grown, lusty, 
goodnatured, nativeborn, out on the vacant lot at sun
down after work,
The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,
The upperhold and underhold, the hair rumpled over and blind
ing the eyes;
The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of mascu
line muscle through cleansetting trowsers and waiststraps,
The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes 
suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,
The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv'd 
neck and the counting;
Suchlike I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's 
breast with the little child,
Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with 
the firemen, and pause, listen, count.




I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,
And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.


                                      



This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,
The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and 
beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the 
richness and breadth of his manners,
These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,
He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were 
massive, clean, bearded, tanfaced, handsome,
They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,
They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal 
love,
He drank water only, the blood show'd like scarlet through the 
clearbrown skin of his face,
He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail'd his boat himself, 
he had a fine one presented to him by a shipjoiner, he 
had fowlingpieces presented to him by men that loved 
him,
When he went with his five sons and many grandsons to hunt or 
fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and 
vigorous of the gang,
You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to 
sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each 
other.




I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough,
To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,
To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh 
is enough,
To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so 
lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this 
then?
I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea.

There is something in staying close to men and women and look
ing on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that 
pleases the soul well,
All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.




This is the female form,
A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,
It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,
I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless 
vapor, all falls aside but myself and it,
Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was 
expected of heaven or fear'd of hell, are now consumed,


                                      



Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response 
likewise ungovernable,
Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all dif 
fused, mine too diffused,
Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, loveflesh swell
ing and deliciously aching,
Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of 
love, whiteblow and delirious juice,
Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the pros
trate dawn,
Undulating into the willing and yielding day,
Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweetflesh'd day.

This the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born 
of woman,
This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the 
outlet again.

Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the 
exit of the rest,
You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.

The female contains all qualities and tempers them,
She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,
She is all things duly veil'd, she is both passive and active,
She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as 
daughters.

As I see my soul reflected in Nature,
As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, 
sanity, beauty,
See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female 
I see.




The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,
He too is all qualities, he is action and power,
The flush of the known universe is in him,
Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him 
well,
The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is 
utmost become him well, pride is for him,
The fullspread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,
Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing 
to the test of himself,



                                      



Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes 
soundings at last only here,
(Where else does he strike soundings except here?)

The man's body is sacred and the woman's body is sacred,
No matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the 
laborers' gang?
Is it one of the dullfaced immigrants just landed on the wharf?
Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the welloff, just 
as much as you,
Each has his or her place in the procession.

(All is a procession,
The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)

Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she 
has no right to a sight?
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, 
and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegeta
tion sprouts,
For you only, and not for him and her?




A man's body at auction,
(For before the war I often go to the slavemart and watch the 
sale,)
I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business.

Gentlemen look on this wonder,
Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it,
For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one 
animal or plant,
For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd.

In this head the allbaffling brain,
In it and below it the makings of heroes.

Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in 
tendon and nerve,
They shall be stript that you may see them.

Exquisite senses, lifelit eyes, pluck, volition,
Flakes of breastmuscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not 
flabby, goodsized arms and legs,
And wonders within there yet.



                                      



Within there runs blood,
The same old blood! the same redrunning blood!
There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, 
aspirations,
(Do you think they are not there because they are not express'd in 
parlors and lecturerooms?)

This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be 
fathers in their turns,
In him the start of populous states and rich republics,
Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and 
enjoyments.

How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his off
spring through the centuries?
(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could 
trace back through the centuries?)




A woman's body at auction,
She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers,
She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the 
mothers.

Have you ever loved the body of a woman?
Have you ever loved the body of a man?
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations 
and times all over the earth?

If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,
And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood 
untainted,
And in man or woman a clean, strong, firmfibred body, is more 
beautiful than the most beautiful face.

Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the 
fool that corrupted her own live body?
For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.




O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and 
women, nor the likes of the parts of you,
I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the 
soul, (and that they are the soul,)


                                      



I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and 
that they are my poems,
Man's, woman's, child's, youth's, wife's, husband's, mother's, father's, 
young man's, young woman's poems,
Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears,
Eyes, eyefringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or 
sleeping of the lids,
Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw
hinges,
Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,
Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck
slue,
Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hindshoulders, and the 
ample sideround of the chest,
Upperarm, armpit, elbowsocket, lowerarm, armsinews, arm
bones,
Wrist and wristjoints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger, 
fingerjoints, fingernails,
Broad breastfront, curling hair of the breast, breastbone, breast
side,
Ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone,
Hips, hipsockets, hipstrength, inward and outward round, man
balls, manroot,
Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above,
Legfibres, knee, kneepan, upperleg, underleg,
Ankles, instep, football, toes, toejoints, the heel;
All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your 
body or of any one's body, male or female,
The lungsponges, the stomachsac, the bowels sweet and clean,
The brain in its folds inside the skullframe,
Sympathies, heartvalves, palatevalves, sexuality, maternity,
Womanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes 
from woman,
The womb, the teats, nipples, breastmilk, tears, laughter, weeping, 
lovelooks, loveperturbations and risings,
The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud,
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming,
Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, armcurving and 
tightening,
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the 
eyes,
The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair,
The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the 
naked meat of the body,
The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out,


                                      



The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence down
ward toward the knees,
The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the 
marrow in the bones,
The exquisite realization of health;
O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but 
of the soul,
O I say now these are the soul!



A WOMAN WAITS FOR ME.

A WOMAN waits for me, she contains all, nothing is lacking,
Yet all were lacking if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of the 
right man were lacking.

Sex contains all, bodies, souls,
Meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results, promulgations,
Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the seminal 
milk,
All hopes, benefactions, bestowals, all the passions, loves, beauties,
delights of the earth,
All the governments, judges, gods, follow'd persons of the earth,
These are contain'd in sex as parts of itself and justifications of 
itself.

Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness 
of his sex,
Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.

Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,
I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women 
that are warmblooded and sufficient for me,
I see that they understand me and do not deny me,
I see that they are worthy of me, I will be the robust husband 
of those women.

They are not one jot less than I am,
They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,
Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,
They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike,
retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,
They are ultimate in their own right—they are calm, clear, well
possess'd of themselves.



                                      



I draw you close to me, you women,
I cannot let you go, I would do you good,
I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own sake, but 
for others' sakes,
Envelop'd in you sleep greater heroes and bards,
They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me.

It is I, you women, I make my way,
I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable, but I love you,
I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,
I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these States, I 
press with slow rude muscle,
I brace myself effectually, I listen to no entreaties,
I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated 
within me.

Through you I drain the pentup rivers of myself,
In you I wrap a thousand onward years,
On you I graft the grafts of the bestbeloved of me and America,
The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls,
new artists, musicians, and singers,
The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,
I shall demand perfect men and women out of my lovespendings,
I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you 
interpenetrate now,
I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as I 
count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now,
I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death, immortality,
I plant so lovingly now.


SPONTANEOUS ME.

SPONTANEOUS me, Nature,
The loving day, the mounting sun, the friend I am happy with,
The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder,
The hillside whiten'd with blossoms of the mountain ash,
The same late in autumn, the hues of red, yellow, drab, purple,
and light and dark green,
The rich coverlet of the grass, animals and birds, the private 
untrimm'd bank, the primitive apples, the pebblestones,
Beautiful dripping fragments, the negligent list of one after an
other as I happen to call them to me or think of them,
The real poems, (what we call poems being merely pictures,)
The poems of the privacy of the night, and of men like me,


                                      



This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry, and that 
all men carry,
(Know once for all, avow'd on purpose, wherever are men like 
me, are our lusty lurking masculine poems,)
Lovethoughts, lovejuice, loveodor, loveyielding, loveclimbers,
and the climbing sap,
Arms and hands of love, lips of love, phallic thumb of love, breasts 
of love, bellies press'd and glued together with love,
Earth of chaste love, life that is only life after love,
The body of my love, the body of the woman I love, the body 
of the man, the body of the earth,
Soft forenoon airs that blow from the southwest,
The hairy wildbee that murmurs and hankers up and down, that 
gripes the fullgrown ladyflower, curves upon her with 
amorous firm legs, takes his will of her, and holds himself 
tremulous and tight till he is satisfied;
The wet of woods through the early hours,
Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep, one with an 
arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other,
The smell of apples, aromas from crush'd sageplant, mint, birch
bark,
The boy's longings, the glow and pressure as he confides to me 
what he was dreaming,
The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and content 
to the ground,
The noform'd stings that sights, people, objects, sting me with,
The hubb'd sting of myself, stinging me as much as it ever can 
any one,
The sensitive, orbic, underlapp'd brothers, that only privileged 
feelers may be intimate where they are,
The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body, the 
bashful withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly 
pause and edge themselves,
The limpid liquid within the young man,
The vex'd corrosion so pensive and so painful,
The torment, the irritable tide that will not be at rest,
The like of the same I feel, the like of the same in others,
The young man that flushes and flushes, and the young woman 
that flushes and flushes,
The young man that wakes deep at night, the hot hand seeking to 
repress what would master him,
The mystic amorous night, the strange halfwelcome pangs, visions,
sweats,
The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling 
fingers, the young man all color'd, red, ashamed, angry;


                                      



The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as I lie willing and naked,
The merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the 
sun, the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them,
The walnuttrunk, the walnuthusks, and the ripening or ripen'd 
longround walnuts,
The continence of vegetables, birds, animals,
The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself 
indecent, while birds and animals never once skulk or 
find themselves indecent,
The great chastity of paternity, to match the great chastity of 
maternity,
The oath of procreation I have sworn, my Adamic and fresh 
daughters,
The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw, till I 
saturate what shall produce boys to fill my place when I 
am through,
The wholesome relief, repose, content,
And this bunch pluck'd at random from myself,
It has done its work—I toss it carelessly to fall where it may.


ONE HOUR TO MADNESS AND JOY.

ONE hour to madness and joy! O furious! O confine me not!
(What is this that frees me so in storms?
What do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean?)

O to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man!
O savage and tender achings! (I bequeath them to you my 
children,
I tell them to you, for reasons, O bridegroom and bride.)

O to be yielded to you whoever you are, and you to be yielded to 
me in defiance of the world!
O to return to Paradise! O bashful and feminine!
O to draw you to me, to plant on you for the first time the lips of 
a determin'd man.

O the puzzle, the thricetied knot, the deep and dark pool, all 
untied and illumin'd!
O to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last!
To be absolv'd from previous ties and conventions, I from mine 
and you from yours!
To find a new unthoughtof nonchalance with the best of Nature!


                                      



To have the gag remov'd from one's mouth!
To have the feeling today or any day I am sufficient as I am.

O something unprov'd! something in a trance!
To escape utterly from others' anchors and holds!
To drive free! to love free! to dash reckless and dangerous!
To court destruction with taunts, with invitations!
To ascend, to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me!
To rise thither with my inebriate soul!
To be lost if it must be so!
To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom!
With one brief hour of madness and joy.


OUT OF THE ROLLING OCEAN THE CROWD.

OUT of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me,
Whispering I love you, before long I die,
I have travel'd a long way merely to look on you to touch you,
For I could not die till I once look'd on you,
For I fear'd I might afterward lose you.

Now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe,
Return in peace to the ocean my love,
I too am part of that ocean my love, we are not so much sepa
rated,
Behold the great rondure, the cohesion of all, how perfect!
But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,
As for an hour carrying us diverse, yet cannot carry us diverse for
ever;
Be not impatient—a little space—know you I salute the air, the 
ocean and the land,
Every day at sundown for your dear sake my love.


AGES AND AGES RETURNING AT INTERVALS.

AGES and ages returning at intervals,
Undestroy'd, wandering immortal,
Lusty, phallic, with the potent original loins, perfectly sweet,
I, chanter of Adamic songs,
Through the new garden the West, the great cities calling,
Deliriate, thus prelude what is generated, offering these, offering 
myself,
Bathing myself, bathing my songs in Sex,
Offspring of my loins.



                                      




WE TWO, HOW LONG WE WERE FOOL'D.

WE two, how long we were fool'd,
Now transmuted, we swiftly escape as Nature escapes,
We are Nature, long have we been absent, but now we return,
We become plants, trunks, foliage, roots, bark,
We are bedded in the ground, we are rocks,
We are oaks, we grow in the openings side by side,
We browse, we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as 
any,
We are two fishes swimming in the sea together,
We are what locust blossoms are, we drop scent around lanes 
mornings and evenings,
We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, minerals,
We are two predatory hawks, we soar above and look down,
We are two resplendent suns, we it is who balance ourselves orbic 
and stellar, we are as two comets,
We prowl fang'd and fourfooted in the woods, we spring on 
prey,
We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead,
We are seas mingling, we are two of those cheerful waves rolling 
over each other and interwetting each other,
We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive, pervious,
impervious,
We are snow, rain, cold, darkness, we are each product and 
influence of the globe,
We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again, we 
two,
We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy.


O HYMEN! O HYMENEE!

O HYMEN! O hymenee! why do you tantalize me thus?
O why sting me for a swift moment only?
Why can you not continue? O why do you now cease?
Is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you 
would soon certainly kill me?


I AM HE THAT ACHES WITH LOVE.

I AM he that aches with amorous love;
Does the earth gravitate? does not all matter, aching, attract all 
matter?
So the body of me to all I meet or know.



                                      




NATIVE MOMENTS.

NATIVE moments—when you come upon me—ah you are here 
now,
Give me now libidinous joys only,
Give me the drench of my passions, give me life coarse and rank,
Today I go consort with Nature's darlings, tonight too,
I am for those who believe in loose delights, I share the midnight 
orgies of young men,
I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers,
The echoes ring with our indecent calls, I pick out some low 
person for my dearest friend,
He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate, he shall be one condemn'd by 
others for deeds done,
I will play a part no longer, why should I exile myself from my 
companions?
O you shunn'd persons, I at least do not shun you,
I come forthwith in your midst, I will be your poet,
I will be more to you than to any of the rest.


ONCE I PASS'D THROUGH A POPULOUS CITY.

ONCE I pass'd through a populous city imprinting my brain for 
future use with its shows, architecture, customs, traditions,
Yet now of all that city I remember only a woman I casually met 
there who detain'd me for love of me,
Day by day and night by night we were together—all else has 
long been forgotten by me,
I remember I say only that woman who passionately clung to me,
Again we wander, we love, we separate again,
Again she holds me by the hand, I must not go,
I see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous.


I HEARD YOU SOLEMNSWEET PIPES OF THE ORGAN.

I HEARD you solemnsweet pipes of the organ as last Sunday morn 
I pass'd the church,
Winds of autumn, as I walk'd the woods at dusk I heard your 
longstretch'd sighs up above so mournful,
I heard the perfect Italian tenor singing at the opera, I heard the 
soprano in the midst of the quartet singing;
Heart of my love! you too I heard murmuring low through one 
of the wrists around my head,
Heard the pulse of you when all was still ringing little bells last 
night under my ear.



                                      




FACING WEST FROM CALIFORNIA'S SHORES.

FACING west from California's shores,
Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
the land of migrations, look afar,
Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kash
mere,
From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the 
hero,
From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
(But where is what I started for so long ago?
And why is it yet unfound?)


AS ADAM EARLY IN THE MORNING.

AS Adam early in the morning,
Walking forth from the bower refresh'd with sleep,
Behold me where I pass, hear my voice, approach,
Touch me, touch the palm of your hand to my body as I pass,
Be not afraid of my body.

CALAMUS.



—————


IN PATHS UNTRODDEN.

IN paths untrodden,
In the growth by margins of pondwaters,
Escaped from the life that exhibits itself,
From all the standards hitherto publish'd, from the pleasures,
profits, conformities,
Which too long I was offering to feed my soul,
Clear to me now standards not yet publish'd, clear to me that my 
soul,
That the soul of the man I speak for rejoices in comrades,
Here by myself away from the clank of the world,
Tallying and talk'd to here by tongues aromatic,


                                      



No longer abash'd, (for in this secluded spot I can respond as I 
would not dare elsewhere,)
Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself, yet contains 
all the rest,
Resolv'd to sing no songs today but those of manly attachment,
Projecting them along that substantial life,
Bequeathing hence types of athletic love,
Afternoon this delicious Ninthmonth in my fortyfirst year,
I proceed for all who are or have been young men,
To tell the secret of my nights and days,
To celebrate the need of comrades.


SCENTED HERBAGE OF MY BREAST.

SCENTED herbage of my breast,
Leaves from you I glean, I write, to be perused best afterwards,
Tombleaves, bodyleaves growing up above me above death,
Perennial roots, tall leaves, O the winter shall not freeze you 
delicate leaves,
Every year shall you bloom again, out from where you retired you 
shall emerge again;
O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or 
inhale your faint odor, but I believe a few will;
O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit you to tell 
in your own way of the heart that is under you,
O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves, you 
are not happiness,
You are often more bitter than I can bear, you burn and sting me,
Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots, you make me 
think of death,
Death is beautiful from you, (what indeed is finally beautiful except 
death and love?)
O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers,
I think it must be for death,
For how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere 
of lovers,
Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer,
(I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most,)
Indeed O death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the same 
as you mean,
Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of my 
breast!
Spring away from the conceal'd heart there!
Do not fold yourself so in your pinktinged roots timid leaves!


                                      



Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!
Come I am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of mine, I 
have long enough stifled and choked;
Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve me 
not,
I will say what I have to say by itself,
I will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again utter a 
call only their call,
I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States,
I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and 
will through the States,
Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating,
Give me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with it,
Give me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all,
and are folded inseparably together, you love and death are,
Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life,
For now it is convey'd to me that you are the purports essential,
That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and that 
they are mainly for you,
That you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality,
That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter 
how long,
That you will one day perhaps take control of all,
That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,
That maybe you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very 
long,
But you will last very long.


WHOEVER YOU ARE HOLDING ME NOW IN HAND.

WHOEVER you are holding me now in hand,
Without one thing all will be useless,
I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,
I am not what you supposed, but far different.

Who is he that would become my follower?
Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?

The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,
You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be 
your sole and exclusive standard,
Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,
The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives 
around you would have to be abandon'd,


                                      



Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let 
go your hand from my shoulders,
Put me down and depart on your way.

Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,
Or back of a rock in the open air,
(For in any roof'd room of a house I emerge not, nor in com
pany,
And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)
But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any 
person for miles around approach unawares,
Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or 
some quiet island,
Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,
With the comrade's longdwelling kiss or the new husband's kiss,
For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.

Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,
Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your 
hip,
Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;
For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,
And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried 
eternally.

But these leaves conning you con at peril,
For these leaves and me you will not understand,
They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will 
certainly elude you,
Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, 
behold!
Already you see I have escaped from you.

For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this 
book,
Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,
Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise 
me,
Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few)
prove victorious,
Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil,
perhaps more,
For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times 
and not hit, that which I hinted at;
Therefore release me and depart on your way.



                                      




FOR YOU O DEMOCRACY.

COME, I will make the continent indissoluble,
I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon,
I will make divine magnetic lands,
With the love of comrades,
With the lifelong love of comrades.

I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of 
America, and along the shores of the great lakes, and all 
over the prairies,
I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each other's 
necks,
By the love of comrades,
By the manly love of comrades.

For you these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!
For you, for you I am trilling these songs.


THESE I SINGING IN SPRING.

THESE I singing in spring collect for lovers,
(For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow and 
joy?
And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)
Collecting I traverse the garden the world, but soon I pass the 
gates,
Now along the pondside, now wading in a little, fearing not the 
wet,
Now by the postandrail fences where the old stones thrown there,
pick'd from the fields, have accumulated,
(Wildflowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones 
and partly cover them, beyond these I pass,)
Far, far in the forest, or sauntering later in summer, before I think 
where I go,
Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the 
silence,
Alone I had thought, yet soon a troop gathers around me,
Some walk by my side and some behind, and some embrace my 
arms or neck,
They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive, thicker they come,
a great crowd, and I in the middle,
Collecting, dispensing, singing, there I wander with them,
Plucking something for tokens, tossing toward whoever is near me,
Here, lilac, with a branch of pine,


                                      



Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull'd off a liveoak 
in Florida as it hung trailing down,
Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,
And here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pond
side,
(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me, and returns again 
never to separate from me,
And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades, this 
calamusroot shall,
Interchange it youths with each other! let none render it back!)
And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut,
And stems of currants and plumblows, and the aromatic cedar,
These I compass'd around by a thick cloud of spirits,
Wandering, point to or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely 
from me,
Indicating to each one what he shall have, giving something to 
each;
But what I drew from the water by the pondside, that I reserve,
I will give of it, but only to them that love as I myself am capable 
of loving.


NOT HEAVING FROM MY RIBB'D BREAST ONLY.

NOT heaving from my ribb'd breast only,
Not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself,
Not in those longdrawn, illsupprest sighs,
Not in many an oath and promise broken,
Not in my wilful and savage soul's volition,
Not in the subtle nourishment of the air,
Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists,
Not in the curious systole and diastole within which will one day 
cease,
Not in many a hungry wish told to the skies only,
Not in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when alone far 
in the wilds,
Not in husky pantings through clinch'd teeth,
Not in sounded and resounded words, chattering words, echoes,
dead words,
Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep,
Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day,
Nor in the limbs and senses of my body that take you and dismiss 
you continually—not there,
Not in any or all of them O adhesiveness! O pulse of my life!
Need I that you exist and show yourself any more than in these 
songs.



                                      




OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES.

OF the terrible doubt of appearances,
Of the uncertainty after all, that we may be deluded,
That maybe reliance and hope are but speculations after all,
That maybe identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,
Maybe the things I perceive, the animals, plants, men, hills,
shining and flowing waters,
The skies of day and night, colors, densities, forms, maybe these 
are (as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real 
something has yet to be known,
(How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and 
mock me!
How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught of 
them,)
Maybe seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed 
but seem) as from my present point of view, and might 
prove (as of course they would) nought of what they 
appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely changed points 
of view;
To me these and the like of these are curiously answer'd by my 
lovers, my dear friends,
When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding 
me by the hand,
When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and 
reason hold not, surround us and pervade us,
Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom, I am 
silent, I require nothing further,
I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity 
beyond the grave,
But I walk or sit indifferent, I am satisfied,
He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.


THE BASE OF ALL METAPHYSICS.

AND now gentlemen,
A word I give to remain in your memories and minds,
As base and finalè too for all metaphysics.

(So to the students the old professor,
At the close of his crowded course.)

Having studied the new and antique, the Greek and Germanic 
systems,
Kant having studied and stated, Fichte and Schelling and Hegel,


                                      



Stated the lore of Plato, and Socrates greater than Plato,
And greater than Socrates sought and stated, Christ divine having 
studied long,
I see reminiscent today those Greek and Germanic systems,
See the philosophies all, Christian churches and tenets see,
Yet underneath Socrates clearly see, and underneath Christ the 
divine I see,
The dear love of man for his comrade, the attraction of friend to 
friend,
Of the wellmarried husband and wife, of children and parents,
Of city for city and land for land.


RECORDERS AGES HENCE.

RECORDERS ages hence,
Come, I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior, I 
will tell you what to say of me,
Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest 
lover,
The friend the lover's portrait, of whom his friend his lover was 
fondest,
Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of 
love within him, and freely pour'd it forth,
Who often walk'd lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends, his 
lovers,
Who pensive away from one he lov'd often lay sleepless and dissat
isfied at night,
Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he lov'd 
might secretly be indifferent to him,
Whose happiest days were far away through fields, in woods, on 
hills, he and another wandering hand in hand, they twain 
apart from other men,
Who oft as he saunter'd the streets curv'd with his arm the shoul
der of his friend, while the arm of his friend rested upon 
him also.


WHEN I HEARD AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY.

WHEN I heard at the close of the day how my name had been 
receiv'd with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy 
night for me that follow'd,
And else when I carous'd, or when my plans were accomplish'd,
still I was not happy,


                                      



But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health,
refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,
When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in 
the morning light,
When I wander'd alone over the beach, and undressing bathed,
laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,
And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way 
coming, O then I was happy,
O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food 
nourish'd me more, and the beautiful day pass'd well,
And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening 
came my friend,
And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly 
continually up the shores,
I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to 
me whispering to congratulate me,
For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover 
in the cool night,
In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined 
toward me,
And his arm lay lightly around my breast—and that night I was 
happy.


ARE YOU THE NEW PERSON DRAWN TOWARD ME?

ARE you the new person drawn toward me?
To begin with take warning, I am surely far different from what 
you suppose;
Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal?
Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover?
Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy'd satisfaction?
Do you think I am trusty and faithful?
Do you see no further than this façade, this smooth and tolerant 
manner of me?
Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real 
heroic man?
Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya, illusion?


ROOTS AND LEAVES THEMSELVES ALONE.

ROOTS and leaves themselves alone are these,
Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and 
pondside,


                                      



Breastsorrel and pinks of love, fingers that wind around tighter 
than vines,
Gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the 
sun is risen,
Breezes of land and love set from living shores to you on the living 
sea, to you O sailors!
Frostmellow'd berries and Thirdmonth twigs offer'd fresh to 
young persons wandering out in the fields when the winter 
breaks up,
Lovebuds put before you and within you whoever you are,
Buds to be unfolded on the old terms,
If you bring the warmth of the sun to them they will open and 
bring form, color, perfume, to you,
If you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers,
fruits, tall branches and trees.


NOT HEAT FLAMES UP AND CONSUMES.

NOT heat flames up and consumes,
Not seawaves hurry in and out,
Not the air delicious and dry, the air of ripe summer, bears lightly 
along white downballs of myriads of seeds,
Wafted, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may;
Not these, O none of these more than the flames of me, consum
ing, burning for his love whom I love,
O none more than I hurrying in and out;
Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never give up? O I 
the same,
O nor downballs nor perfumes, nor the high rainemitting clouds,
are borne through the open air,
Any more than my soul is borne through the open air,
Wafted in all directions O love, for friendship, for you.


TRICKLE DROPS.

TRICKLE drops! my blue veins leaving!
O drops of me! trickle, slow drops,
Candid from me falling, drip, bleeding drops,
From wounds made to free you whence you were prison'd,
From my face, from my forehead and lips,
From my breast, from within where I was conceal'd, press forth 
red drops, confession drops,
Stain every page, stain every song I sing, every word I say, bloody 
drops,


                                      



Let them know your scarlet heat, let them glisten,
Saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet,
Glow upon all I have written or shall write, bleeding drops,
Let it all be seen in your light, blushing drops.


CITY OF ORGIES.

CITY of orgies, walks and joys,
City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day 
make you illustrious,
Not the pageants of you, not your shifting tableaus, your specta
cles, repay me,
Not the interminable rows of your houses, nor the ships at the 
wharves,
Nor the processions in the streets, nor the bright windows with 
goods in them,
Nor to converse with learn'd persons, or bear my share in the soiree 
or feast;
Not those, but as I pass O Manhattan, your frequent and swift 
flash of eyes offering me love,
Offering response to my own—these repay me,
Lovers, continual lovers, only repay me.


BEHOLD THIS SWARTHY FACE.

BEHOLD this swarthy face, these gray eyes,
This beard, the white wool unclipt upon my neck,
My brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm;
Yet comes one a Manhattanese and ever at parting kisses me 
lightly on the lips with robust love,
And I on the crossing of the street or on the ship's deck give a 
kiss in return,
We observe that salute of American comrades land and sea,
We are those two natural and nonchalant persons.


I SAW IN LOUISIANA A LIVEOAK GROWING.

I SAW in Louisiana a liveoak growing,
All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,
Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous leaves of 
dark green,
And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,
But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone 
there without its friend near, for I knew I could not,


                                      



And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it,
and twined around it a little moss,
And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room,
It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,
(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)
Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly 
love;
For all that, and though the liveoak glistens there in Louisiana 
solitary in a wide flat space,
Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near,
I know very well I could not.


TO A STRANGER.

PASSING stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon 
you,
You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, (it comes to 
me as of a dream,)
I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you,
All is recall'd as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate, chaste,
matured,
You grew up with me, were a boy with me or a girl with me,
I ate with you and slept with you, your body has become not yours 
only nor left my body mine only,
You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass, you 
take of my beard, breast, hands, in return,
I am not to speak to you, I am to think of you when I sit alone 
or wake at night alone,
I am to wait, I do not doubt I am to meet you again,
I am to see to it that I do not lose you.


THIS MOMENT YEARNING AND THOUGHTFUL.

THIS moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone,
It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and 
thoughtful,
It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Germany,
Italy, France, Spain,
Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or Japan, talking other 
dialects,
And it seems to me if I could know those men I should become 
attached to them as I do to men in my own lands,
O I know we should be brethren and lovers,
I know I should be happy with them.



                                      




I HEAR IT WAS CHARGED AGAINST ME.

I HEAR it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institu
tions,
But really I am neither for nor against institutions,
(What indeed have I in common with them? or what with the 
destruction of them?)
Only I will establish in the Mannahatta and in every city of these 
States inland and seaboard,
And in the fields and woods, and above every keel little or large 
that dents the water,
Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument,
The institution of the dear love of comrades.


THE PRAIRIEGRASS DIVIDING.

THE prairiegrass dividing, its special odor breathing,
I demand of it the spiritual corresponding,
Demand the most copious and close companionship of men,
Demand the blades to rise of words, acts, beings,
Those of the open atmosphere, coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious,
Those that go their own gait, erect, stepping with freedom and 
command, leading not following,
Those with a neverquell'd audacity, those with sweet and lusty 
flesh clear of taint,
Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governors,
as to say Who are you?
Those of earthborn passion, simple, never constrain'd, never 
obedient,
Those of inland America.


WHEN I PERUSE THE CONQUER'D FAME.

WHEN I peruse the conquer'd fame of heroes and the victories 
of mighty generals, I do not envy the generals,
Nor the President in his Presidency, nor the rich in his great 
house,
But when I hear of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with 
them,
How together through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, 
long and long,
Through youth and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, 
how affectionate and faithful they were,
Then I am pensive—I hastily walk away fill'd with the bitterest 
envy.



                                      




WE TWO BOYS TOGETHER CLINGING.

WE two boys together clinging,
One the other never leaving,
Up and down the roads going, North and South excursions 
making,
Power enjoying, elbows stretching, fingers clutching,
Arm'd and fearless, eating, drinking, sleeping, loving,
No law less than ourselves owning, sailing, soldiering, thieving,
threatening,
Misers, menials, priests alarming, air breathing, water drinking, on 
the turf or the seabeach dancing,
Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, feebleness chas
ing,
Fulfilling our foray.


A PROMISE TO CALIFORNIA.

A PROMISE to California,
Or inland to the great pastoral Plains, and on to Puget sound and 
Oregon;
Sojourning east a while longer, soon I travel toward you, to remain,
to teach robust American love,
For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you,
inland, and along the Western sea;
For these States tend inland and toward the Western sea, and I 
will also.


HERE THE FRAILEST LEAVES OF ME.

HERE the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting,
Here I shade and hide my thoughts, I myself do not expose them,
And yet they expose me more than all my other poems.


NO LABORSAVING MACHINE.

NO laborsaving machine,
Nor discovery have I made,
Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to 
found a hospital or library,
Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for America,
Nor literary success nor intellect, nor book for the bookshelf,
But a few carols vibrating through the air I leave,
For comrades and lovers.



                                      




A GLIMPSE.

A GLIMPSE through an interstice caught,
Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a barroom around the 
stove late of a winter night, and I unremark'd seated in a 
corner,
Of a youth who loves me and whom I love, silently approaching 
and seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand,
A long while amid the noises of coming and going, of drinking 
and oath and smutty jest,
There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little,
perhaps not a word.


A LEAF FOR HAND IN HAND.

A LEAF for hand in hand;
You natural persons old and young!
You on the Mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of the 
Mississippi!
You friendly boatmen and mechanics! you roughs!
You twain! and all processions moving along the streets!
I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it common for you to 
walk hand in hand.


EARTH, MY LIKENESS.

EARTH, my likeness,
Though you look so impassive, ample and spheric there,
I now suspect that is not all;
I now suspect there is something fierce in you eligible to burst forth,
For an athlete is enamour'd of me, and I of him,
But toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me eligi
ble to burst forth,
I dare not tell it in words, not even in these songs.


I DREAM'D IN A DREAM.

I DREAM'D in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the 
whole of the rest of the earth,
I dream'd that was the new city of Friends,
Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love, it led 
the rest,
It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,
And in all their looks and words.



                                      




WHAT THINK YOU I TAKE MY PEN IN HAND?

WHAT think you I take my pen in hand to record?
The battleship, perfectmodel'd, majestic, that I saw pass the 
offing today under full sail?
The splendors of the past day? or the splendor of the night that 
envelops me?
Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around 
me?—no;
But merely of two simple men I saw today on the pier in the 
midst of the crowd, parting the parting of dear friends,
The one to remain hung on the other's neck and passionately 
kiss'd him,
While the one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in his 
arms.


TO THE EAST AND TO THE WEST.

TO the East and to the West,
To the man of the Seaside State and of Pennsylvania,
To the Kanadian of the north, to the Southerner I love,
These with perfect trust to depict you as myself, the germs are in 
all men,
I believe the main purport of these States is to found a superb 
friendship, exaltè, previously unknown,
Because I perceive it waits, and has been always waiting, latent in 
all men.


SOMETIMES WITH ONE I LOVE.

SOMETIMES with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse 
unreturn'd love,
But now I think there is no unreturn'd love, the pay is certain one 
way or another,
(I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return'd,
Yet out of that I have written these songs.)


TO A WESTERN BOY.

MANY things to absorb I teach to help you become eleve of mine;
Yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins,
If you be not silently selected by lovers and do not silently select 
lovers,
Of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine?



                                      




FAST ANCHOR'D ETERNAL O LOVE!

FASTANCHOR'D eternal O love! O woman I love!
O bride! O wife! more resistless than I can tell, the thought of 
you!
Then separate, as disembodied or another born,
Ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation,
I ascend, I float in the regions of your love O man,
O sharer of my roving life.


AMONG THE MULTITUDE.

AMONG the men and women the multitude,
I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs,
Acknowledging none else, not parent, wife, husband, brother,
child, any nearer than I am,
Some are baffled, but that one is not—that one knows me.

Ah lover and perfect equal,
I meant that you should discover me so by faint indirections,
And I when I meet you mean to discover you by the like in you.


O YOU WHOM I OFTEN AND SILENTLY COME.

O YOU whom I often and silently come where you are that I may 
be with you,
As I walk by your side or sit near, or remain in the same room 
with you,
Little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is play
ing within me.


THAT SHADOW MY LIKENESS.

THAT shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a liveli
hood, chattering, chaffering,
How often I find myself standing and looking at it where it 
flits,
How often I question and doubt whether that is really me;
But among my lovers and caroling these songs,
O I never doubt whether that is really me.


FULL OF LIFE NOW.

FULL of life now, compact, visible,
I, forty years old the eightythird year of the States,


                                      



To one a century hence or any number of centuries hence,
To you yet unborn these, seeking you.

When you read these I that was visible am become invisible,
Now it is you, compact, visible, realizing my poems, seeking me,
Fancying how happy you were if I could be with you and become 
your comrade;
Be it as if I were with you. (Be not too certain but I am now 
with you.)

SALUT AU MONDE!



O TAKE my hand Walt Whitman!
Such gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!
Such join'd unended links, each hook'd to the next,
Each answering all, each sharing the earth with all.

What widens within you Walt Whitman?
What waves and soils exuding?
What climes? what persons and cities are here?
Who are the infants, some playing, some slumbering?
Who are the girls? who are the married women?
Who are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms about 
each other's necks?
What rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?
What are the mountains call'd that rise so high in the mists?
What myriads of dwellings are they fill'd with dwellers?




Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens,
Asia, Africa, Europe, are to the east—America is provided for in 
the west,
Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,
Curiously north and south turn the axisends,
Within me is the longest day, the sun wheels in slanting rings, it 
does not set for months,
Stretch'd in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above 
the horizon and sinks again,
Within me zones, seas, cataracts, forests, volcanoes, groups,
Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.




                                      





What do you hear Walt Whitman?

I hear the workman singing and the farmer's wife singing,
I hear in the distance the sounds of children and of animals early 
in the day,
I hear emulous shouts of Australians pursuing the wild horse,
I hear the Spanish dance with castanets in the chestnut shade, to 
the rebeck and guitar,
I hear continual echoes from the Thames,
I hear fierce French liberty songs,
I hear of the Italian boatsculler the musical recitative of old 
poems,
I hear the locusts in Syria as they strike the grain and grass with 
the showers of their terrible clouds,
I hear the Coptic refrain toward sundown, pensively falling on the 
breast of the black venerable vast mother the Nile,
I hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and the bells of the 
mule,
I hear the Arab muezzin calling from the top of the mosque,
I hear the Christian priests at the altars of their churches, I hear 
the responsive base and soprano,
I hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice putting to sea 
at Okotsk,
I hear the wheeze of the slavecoffle as the slaves march on, as 
the husky gangs pass on by twos and threes, fasten'd together 
with wristchains and anklechains,
I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms,
I hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong legends 
of the Romans,
I hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death of the beautiful 
God the Christ,
I hear the Hindoo teaching his favorite pupil the loves, wars,
adages, transmitted safely to this day from poets who wrote 
three thousand years ago.




What do you see Walt Whitman?
Who are they you salute, and that one after another salute you?

I see a great round wonder rolling through space,
I see diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, graveyards, jails, factories,
palaces, hovels, huts of barbarians, tents of nomads upon 
the surface,



                                      



I see the shaded part on one side where the sleepers are sleeping,
and the sunlit part on the other side,
I see the curious rapid change of the light and shade,
I see distant lands, as real and near to the inhabitants of them as 
my land is to me.

I see plenteous waters,
I see mountain peaks, I see the sierras of Andes where they range,
I see plainly the Himalayas, Chian Shahs, Altays, Ghauts,
I see the giant pinnacles of Elbruz, Kazbek, Bazardjusi,
I see the Styrian Alps, and the Karnac Alps,
I see the Pyrenees, Balks, Carpathians, and to the north the 
Dofrafields, and off at sea mount Hecla,
I see Vesuvius and Etna, the mountains of the Moon, and the 
Red mountains of Madagascar,
I see the Lybian, Arabian, and Asiatic deserts,
I see huge dreadful Arctic and Antarctic icebergs,
I see the superior oceans and the inferior ones, the Atlantic and 
Pacific, the sea of Mexico, the Brazilian sea, and the sea 
of Peru,
The waters of Hindustan, the China sea, and the gulf of Guinea,
The Japan waters, the beautiful bay of Nagasaki landlock'd in its 
mountains,
The spread of the Baltic, Caspian, Bothnia, the British shores, and 
the bay of Biscay,
The clearsunn'd Mediterranean, and from one to another of its 
islands,
The White sea, and the sea around Greenland.

I behold the mariners of the world,
Some are in storms, some in the night with the watch on the look
out,
Some drifting helplessly, some with contagious diseases.

I behold the sail and steamships of the world, some in clusters in 
port, some on their voyages,
Some double the cape of Storms, some cape Verde, others capes 
Guardafui, Bon, or Bajadore,
Others Dondra head, others pass the straits of Sunda, others cape 
Lopatka, others Behring's straits,
Others cape Horn, others sail the gulf of Mexico or along Cuba 
or Hayti, others Hudson's bay or Baffin's bay,
Others pass the straits of Dover, others enter the Wash, others the 
firth of Solway, others round cape Clear, others the Land's 
End,


                                      



Others traverse the Zuyder Zee or the Scheld,
Others as comers and goers at Gibraltar or the Dardanelles,
Others sternly push their way through the northern winterpacks,
Others descend or ascend the Obi or the Lena,
Others the Niger or the Congo, others the Indus, the Burampooter 
and Cambodia,
Others wait steam'd up ready to start in the ports of Australia,
Wait at Liverpool, Glasgow, Dublin, Marseilles, Lisbon, Naples,
Hamburg, Bremen, Bordeaux, the Hague, Copenhagen,
Wait at Valparaiso, Rio Janeiro, Panama.




I see the tracks of the railroads of the earth,
I see them in Great Britain, I see them in Europe,
I see them in Asia and in Africa.

I see the electric telegraphs of the earth,
I see the filaments of the news of the wars, deaths, losses, gains,
passions, of my race.

I see the long riverstripes of the earth,
I see the Amazon and the Paraguay,
I see the four great rivers of China, the Amour, the Yellow River,
the Yiangtse, and the Pearl,
I see where the Seine flows, and where the Danube, the Loire, the 
Rhone, and the Guadalquiver flow,
I see the windings of the Volga, the Dnieper, the Oder,
I see the Tuscan going down the Arno, and the Venetian along 
the Po,
I see the Greek seaman sailing out of Egina bay.




I see the site of the old empire of Assyria, and that of Persia, and 
that of India,
I see the falling of the Ganges over the high rim of Saukara.

I see the place of the idea of the Deity incarnated by avatars in 
human forms,
I see the spots of the successions of priests on the earth, oracles,
sacrificers, brahmins, sabians, llamas, monks, muftis, ex
horters,
I see where druids walk'd the groves of Mona, I see the mistletoe 
and vervain,
I see the temples of the deaths of the bodies of Gods, I see the 
old signifiers.



                                      



I see Christ eating the bread of his last supper in the midst of 
youths and old persons,
I see where the strong divine young man the Hercules toil'd faith
fully and long and then died,
I see the place of the innocent rich life and hapless fate of the 
beautiful nocturnal son, the fulllimb'd Bacchus,
I see Kneph, blooming, drest in blue, with the crown of feathers 
on his head,
I see Hermes, unsuspected, dying, wellbelov'd, saying to the 
people Do not weep for me,
This is not my true country, I have lived banish'd from my true 
country, I now go back there,
I return to the celestial sphere where every one goes in his turn.




I see the battlefields of the earth, grass grows upon them and 
blossoms and corn,
I see the tracks of ancient and modern expeditions.

I see the nameless masonries, venerable messages of the unknown 
events, heroes, records of the earth.

I see the places of the sagas,
I see pinetrees and firtrees torn by northern blasts,
I see granite bowlders and cliffs, I see green meadows and lakes,
I see the burialcairns of Scandinavian warriors,
I see them raised high with stones by the marge of restless oceans,
that the dead men's spirits when they wearied of their quiet 
graves might rise up through the mounds and gaze on the 
tossing billows, and be refresh'd by storms, immensity,
liberty, action.

I see the steppes of Asia,
I see the tumuli of Mongolia, I see the tents of Kalmucks and 
Baskirs,
I see the nomadic tribes with herds of oxen and cows,
I see the tablelands notch'd with ravines, I see the jungles and 
deserts,
I see the camel, the wild steed, the bustard, the fattail'd sheep,
the antelope, and the burrowing wolf.

I see the highlands of Abyssinia,
I see flocks of goats feeding, and see the figtree, tamarind, date,
And see fields of teffwheat and places of verdure and gold.



                                      



I see the Brazilian vaquero,
I see the Bolivian ascending mount Sorata,
I see the Wacho crossing the plains, I see the incomparable rider 
of horses with his lasso on his arm,
I see over the pampas the pursuit of wild cattle for their hides.




I see the regions of snow and ice,
I see the sharp eyed Samoiede and the Finn,
I see the sealseeker in his boat poising his lance,
I see the Siberian on his slightbuilt sledge drawn by dogs,
I see the porpoisehunters, I see the whalecrews of the south Pa
cific and the north Atlantic,
I see the cliffs, glaciers, torrents, valleys, of Switzerland—I mark 
the long winters and the isolation.

I see the cities of the earth and make myself at random a part of 
them,
I am a real Parisian,
I am a habitan of Vienna, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Constantinople,
I am of Adelaide, Sidney, Melbourne,
I am of London, Manchester, Bristol, Edinburgh, Limerick,
I am of Madrid, Cadiz, Barcelona, Oporto, Lyons, Brussels, Berne,
Frankfort, Stuttgart, Turin, Florence,
I belong in Moscow, Cracow, Warsaw, or northward in Christiania 
or Stockholm, or in Siberian Irkutsk, or in some street in 
Iceland,
I descend upon all those cities, and rise from them again.




I see vapors exhaling from unexplored countries,
I see the savage types, the bow and arrow, the poison'd splint, the 
fetich, and the obi.

I see African and Asiatic towns,
I see Algiers, Tripoli, Derne, Mogadore, Timbuctoo, Monrovia,
I see the swarms of Pekin, Canton, Benares, Delhi, Calcutta, Tokio,
I see the Kruman in his hut, and the Dahoman and Ashanteeman 
in their huts,
I see the Turk smoking opium in Aleppo,
I see the picturesque crowds at the fairs of Khiva and those of 
Herat,
I see Teheran, I see Muscat and Medina and the intervening sands,
I see the caravans toiling onward,


                                      



I see Egypt and the Egyptians, I see the pyramids and obelisks,
I look on chisell'd histories, records of conquering kings, dynasties,
cut in slabs of sandstone, or on graniteblocks,
I see at Memphis mummypits containing mummies embalm'd,
swathed in linen cloth, lying there many centuries,
I look on the fall'n Theban, the largeball'd eyes, the sidedrooping 
neck, the hands folded across the breast.

I see all the menials of the earth, laboring,
I see all the prisoners in the prisons,
I see the defective human bodies of the earth,
The blind, the deaf and dumb, idiots, hunchbacks, lunatics,
The pirates, thieves, betrayers, murderers, slavemakers of the earth,
The helpless infants, and the helpless old men and women.

I see male and female everywhere,
I see the serene brotherhood of philosophs,
I see the constructiveness of my race,
I see the results of the perseverance and industry of my race,
I see ranks, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, I go among them, I 
mix indiscriminately,
And I salute all the inhabitants of the earth.

You benighted roamer of Amazonia! you Patagonian! you Feejee
man!
I do not prefer others so very much before you either,
I do not say one word against you, away back there where you 
stand,
(You will come forward in due time to my side.)




My spirit has pass'd in compassion and determination around the 
whole earth,
I have look'd for equals and lovers and found them ready for me 
in all lands,
I think some divine rapport has equalized me with them.

You vapors, I think I have risen with you, moved away to distant 
continents, and fallen down there, for reasons,
I think I have blown with you you winds;
You waters I have finger'd every shore with you,
I have run through what any river or strait of the globe has run 
through,
I have taken my stand on the bases of peninsulas and on the high 
embedded rocks, to cry thence:

Salut au monde!
What cities the light or warmth penetrates I penetrate those cities 
myself,
All islands to which birds wing their way I wing my way myself.

Toward you all, in America's name,
I raise high the perpendicular hand, I make the signal,
To remain after me in sight forever,
For all the haunts and homes of men.



SONG OF THE OPEN ROAD.



AFOOT and lighthearted I take to the open road,
Healthy, free, the world before me,
The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.



                                      



Henceforth I ask not goodfortune, I myself am goodfortune,
Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,
Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,
Strong and content I travel the open road.

The earth, that is sufficient,
I do not want the constellations any nearer,
I know they are very well where they are,
I know they suffice for those who belong to them.

(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,
I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,
I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,
I am fill'd with them, and I will fill them in return.)




You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all 
that is here,
I believe that much unseen is also here.

Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,
The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd, the illiterate 
person, are not denied;
The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's tramp, the 
drunkard's stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,
The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, the eloping 
couple,
The early marketman, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the 
town, the return back from the town,
They pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted,
None but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.




You air that serves me with breath to speak!
You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them 
shape!
You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers!
You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!
I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear 
to me.

You flagg'd walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!
You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timberlined 
sides! you distant ships!


                                      



You rows of houses! you windowpierc'd façades! you roofs!
You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!
You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!
You doors and ascending steps! you arches!
You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!
From all that has touch'd you I believe you have imparted to 
yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,
From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive 
surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and 
amicable with me.




The earth expanding right hand and left hand,
The picture alive, every part in its best light,
The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is 
not wanted,
The cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment of 
the road.

O highway I travel, do you say to me Do not leave me?
Do you say Venture not—if you leave me you are lost?
Do you say I am already prepared, I am wellbeaten and un
denied, adhere to me?

O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love 
you,
You express me better than I can express myself,
You shall be more to me than my poem.

I think heroic deeds were all conceiv'd in the open air, and all 
free poems also,
I think I could stop here myself and do miracles,
I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and who
ever beholds me shall like me,
I think whoever I see must be happy.




From this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and imaginary 
lines,
Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,
Listening to others, considering well what they say,
Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,
Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds 
that would hold me.



                                      



I inhale great draughts of space,
The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are 
mine.

I am larger, better than I thought,
I did not know I held so much goodness.

All seems beautiful to me,
I can repeat over to men and women You have done such good 
to me I would do the same to you,
I will recruit for myself and you as I go,
I will scatter myself among men and women as I go,
I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,
Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me,
Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me.




Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze 
me,
Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd it would 
not astonish me.

Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,
It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.

Here a great personal deed has room,
(Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,
Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all 
authority and all argument against it.)

Here is the test of wisdom,
Wisdom is not finally tested in schools,
Wisdom cannot be pass'd from one having it to another not 
having it,
Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,
Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,
Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the 
excellence of things;
Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes 
it out of the soul.

Now I reexamine philosophies and religions,
They may prove well in lecturerooms, yet not prove at all under 
the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing 
currents.



                                      



Here is realization,
Here is a man tallied—he realizes here what he has in him,
The past, the future, majesty, love—if they are vacant of you,
you are vacant of them.

Only the kernel of every object nourishes;
Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?
Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?

Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion'd, it is apropos;
Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?
Do you know the talk of those turning eyeballs?




Here is the efflux of the soul,
The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower'd 
gates, ever provoking questions,
These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness 
why are they?
Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the 
sunlight expands my blood?
Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?
Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious 
thoughts descend upon me?
(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and 
always drop fruit as I pass;)
What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?
What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?
What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I 
walk by and pause?
What gives me to be free to a woman's and man's goodwill?
what gives them to be free to mine?




The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,
I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,
Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.

Here rises the fluid and attaching character,
The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness 
of man and woman,
(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every 
day out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh 
and sweet continually out of itself.)



                                      



Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the 
love of young and old,
From it falls distill'd the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,
Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.




Allons! whoever you are come travel with me!
Traveling with me you find what never tires.

The earth never tires,
The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is rude 
and incomprehensible at first,
Be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop'd,
I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words 
can tell.

Allons! we must not stop here,
However sweet these laidup stores, however convenient this dwell
ing we cannot remain here,
However shelter'd this port and however calm these waters we 
must not anchor here,
However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are per
mitted to receive it but a little while.




Allons! the inducements shall be greater,
We will sail pathless and wild seas,
We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee clipper 
speeds by under full sail.

Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements,
Health, defiance, gayety, selfesteem, curiosity;
Allons! from all formules!
From your formules, O bateyed and materialistic priests.

The stale cadaver blocks up the passage—the burial waits no 
longer.

Allons! yet take warning!
He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance,
None may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health,
Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself,
Only those may come who come in sweet and determin'd bodies,
No diseas'd person, no rumdrinker or venereal taint is permitted 
here.



                                      



(I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes,
We convince by our presence.)




Listen! I will be honest with you,
I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes,
These are the days that must happen to you:
You shall not heap up what is call'd riches,
You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve,
You but arrive at the city to which you were destin'd, you hardly 
settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call'd by an 
irresistible call to depart,
You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those 
who remain behind you,
What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with 
passionate kisses of parting,
You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach'd 
hands toward you.




Allons! after the great Companions, and to belong to them!
They too are on the road—they are the swift and majestic men—
they are the greatest women,
Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas,
Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land,
Habituès of many distant countries, habituès of fardistant dwellings,
Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers,
Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore,
Dancers at weddingdances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of 
children, bearers of children,
Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerersdown of 
coffins,
Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the curious 
years each emerging from that which preceded it,
Journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse phases,
Forthsteppers from the latent unrealized babydays,
Journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their 
bearded and wellgrain'd manhood,
Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd, content,
Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or woman
hood,
Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the 
universe,
Old age, flowing free with the delicious nearby freedom of death.




                                      





Allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless,
To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights,
To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights 
they tend to,
Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys,
To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it,
To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it 
and pass it,
To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you,
however long but it stretches and waits for you,
To see no being, not God's or any, but you also go thither,
To see no possession, but you may possess it, enjoying all without 
labor or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting 
one particle of it,
To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's elegant 
villa, and the chaste blessings of the wellmarried couple,
and the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens,
To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through,
To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go,
To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter 
them, to gather the love out of their hearts,
To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave 
them behind you,
To know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads for 
traveling souls.

All parts away for the progress of souls,
All religion, all solid things, arts, governments—all that was or is 
apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and 
corners before the procession of souls along the grand roads 
of the universe.

Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand 
roads of the universe, all other progress is the needed 
emblem and sustenance.

Forever alive, forever forward,
Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble,
dissatisfied,
Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men,
They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not where 
they go,
But I know that they go toward the best—toward something 
great.



                                      



Whoever you are, come forth! or man or woman come forth!
You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house,
though you built it, or though it has been built for you.

Out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen!
It is useless to protest, I know all and expose it.

Behold through you as bad as the rest,
Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people,
Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and 
trimm'd faces,
Behold a secret silent loathing and despair.

No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession,
Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes,
Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and 
bland in the parlors,
In the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly,
Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bed
room, everywhere,
Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under 
the breastbones, hell under the skullbones,
Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial 
flowers,
Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself,
Speaking of any thing else but never of itself.




Allons! through struggles and wars!
The goal that was named cannot be countermanded.

Have the past struggles succeeded?
What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? Nature?
Now understand me well—it is provided in the essence of things 
that from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall 
come forth something to make a greater struggle necessary.

My call is the call of battle, I nourish active rebellion,
He going with me must go well arm'd,
He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry 
enemies, desertions.




Allons! the road is before us!
It is safe—I have tried it—my own feet have tried it well—be 
not detain'd!



                                      



Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the 
shelf unopen'd!
Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain 
unearn'd!
Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher!
Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the 
court, and the judge expound the law.

Camerado, I give you my hand!
I give you my love more precious than money,
I give you myself before preaching or law;
Will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me?
Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?



CROSSING BROOKLYN FERRY.



FLOODTIDE below me! I see you face to face!
Clouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—I see you 
also face to face.

Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how 
curious you are to me!
On the ferryboats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, return
ing home, are more curious to me than you suppose,
And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are 
more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might 
suppose.




The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of 
the day,
The simple, compact, welljoin'd scheme, myself disintegrated,
every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,
The similitudes of the past and those of the future,
The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings,
on the walk in the street and the passage over the river,
The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,
The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,
The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.

Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to 
shore,


                                      



Others will watch the run of the floodtide,
Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and 
the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,
Others will see the islands large and small;
Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half 
an hour high,
A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence,
others will see them,
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouringin of the floodtide, the falling
back to the sea of the ebbtide.




It avails not, time nor place—distance avails not,
I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so 
many generations hence,
Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,
Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,
Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the 
bright flow, I was refresh'd,
Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift 
current, I stood yet was hurried,
Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick
stemm'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.

I too many and many a time cross'd the river of old,
Watched the Twelfthmonth seagulls, saw them high in the air 
floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,
Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left 
the rest in strong shadow,
Saw the slowwheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the 
south,
Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,
Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,
Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of 
my head in the sunlit water,
Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward,
Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,
Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,
Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,
Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,
The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,
The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender 
serpentine pennants,
The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot
houses,


                                      



The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of 
the wheels,
The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,
The scallopedged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the 
frolicsome crests and glistening,
The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of 
the granite storehouses by the docks,
On the river the shadowy group, the big steamtug closely flank'd 
on each side by the barges, the hayboat, the belated 
lighter,
On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys 
burning high and glaringly into the night,
Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow 
light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of 
streets.




These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,
I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,
The men and women I saw were all near to me,
Others the same—others who look back on me because I look'd 
forward to them,
(The time will come, though I stop here today and tonight.)




What is it then between us?
What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?

Whatever it is, it avails not—distance avails not, and place avails 
not,
I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,
I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the 
waters around it,
I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,
In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,
In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came 
upon me,
I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,
I too had receiv'd identity by my body,
That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew 
I should be of my body.




It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,
The dark threw its patches down upon me also,


                                      



The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,
My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality 
meagre?
Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,
I am he who knew what it was to be evil,
I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,
Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,
Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,
Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,
The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,
The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not 
wanting,
Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these 
wanting,
Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,
Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men 
as they saw me approaching or passing,
Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of 
their flesh against me as I sat,
Saw many I loved in the street or ferryboat or public assembly,
yet never told them a word,
Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing,
sleeping,
Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,
The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we 
like,
Or as small as we like, or both great and small.




Closer yet I approach you,
What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you—I laid 
in my stores in advance,
I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.

Who was to know what should come home to me?
Who knows but I am enjoying this?
Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at 
you now, for all you cannot see me?




Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast
hemm'd Manhattan?
River and sunset and scallopedg'd waves of floodtide?
The seagulls oscillating their bodies, the hayboat in the twilight,
and the belated lighter?


                                      



What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with 
voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest 
name as I approach?
What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man 
that looks in my face?
Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?

We understand then do we not?
What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?
What the study could not teach—what the preaching could not 
accomplish is accomplish'd, is it not?




Flow on, river! flow with the floodtide, and ebb with the ebb
tide!
Frolic on, crested and scallopedg'd waves!
Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or 
the men and women generations after me!
Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!
Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of 
Brooklyn!
Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!
Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!
Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public 
assembly!
Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by 
my nighest name!
Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!
Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one 
makes it!
Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown 
ways be looking upon you;
Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet 
haste with the hasting current;
Fly on, seabirds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in 
the air;
Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all 
downcast eyes have time to take it from you!
Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any 
one's head, in the sunlit water!
Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, whitesail'd 
schooners, sloops, lighters!
Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset!
Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at 
nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the 
houses!


                                      



Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,
You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,
About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out 
divinest aromas,
Thrive, cities—bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and 
sufficient rivers,
Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,
Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.

You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,
We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate hence
forward,
Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves 
from us,
We use you, and do not cast you aside—we plant you perma
nently within us,
We fathom you not—we love you—there is perfection in you also,
You furnish your parts toward eternity,
Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.



SONG OF THE ANSWERER.



NOW list to my morning's romanza, I tell the signs of the Answerer,
To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine 
before me.

A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother,
How shall the young man know the whether and when of his 
brother?
Tell him to send me the signs.

And I stand before the young man face to face, and take his right 
hand in my left hand and his left hand in my right hand,
And I answer for his brother and for men, and I answer for him 
that answers for all, and send these signs.

Him all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive and final,
Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves as amid 
light,
Him they immerse and he immerses them.



                                      



Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape,
people, animals,
The profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean, (so 
tell I my morning's romanza,)
All enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money 
will buy,
The best farms, others toiling and planting and he unavoidably 
reaps,
The noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building and 
he domiciles there,
Nothing for any one but what is for him, near and far are for him,
the ships in the offing,
The perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are 
for anybody.

He puts things in their attitudes,
He puts today out of himself with plasticity and love,
He places his own times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and 
sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest 
never shame them afterward, nor assume to command 
them.

He is the Answerer,
What can be answer'd he answers, and what cannot be answer'd 
he shows how it cannot be answer'd.

A man is a summons and challenge,
(It is vain to skulk—do you hear that mocking and laughter? do 
you hear the ironical echoes?)

Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride,
beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction,
He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and 
down also.

Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly 
and gently and safely by day or by night,
He has the passkey of hearts, to him the response of the prying 
of hands on the knobs.

His welcome is universal, the flow of beauty is not more welcome 
or universal than he is,
The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.

Every existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue,


                                      



He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and 
any man translates, and any man translates himself also,
One part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner, he 
sees how they join.

He says indifferently and alike How are you friend? to the 
President at his levee,
And he says Goodday my brother, to Cudge that hoes in the 
sugarfield,
And both understand him and know that his speech is right.

He walks with perfect ease in the capitol,
He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to 
another, Here is our equal appearing and new.

Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,
And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that 
he has follow'd the sea,
And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an 
artist,
And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them,
No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or has 
follow'd it,
No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and 
sisters there.

The English believe he comes of their English stock,
A Jew to the Jew he seems, a Russ to the Russ, usual and near,
removed from none.

Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffeehouse claims him,
The Italian or Frenchman is sure, the German is sure, the Spaniard 
is sure, and the island Cuban is sure,
The engineer, the deckhand on the great lakes, or on the Missis
sippi or St. Lawrence or Sacramento, or Hudson or Pau
manok sound, claims him.

The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,
The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see 
themselves in the ways of him, he strangely transmutes them,
They are not vile any more, they hardly know themselves they are 
so grown.




The indications and tally of time,
Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs,


                                      



Time, always without break, indicates itself in parts,
What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant com
pany of singers, and their words,
The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or 
dark, but the words of the maker of poems are the general 
light and dark,
The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,
His insight and power encircle things and the human race,
He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human 
race.

The singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,
The singers are welcom'd, understood, appear often enough, but 
rare has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the 
maker of poems, the Answerer,
(Not every century nor every five centuries has contain'd such a 
day, for all its names.)

The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible 
names, but the name of each of them is one of the singers,
The name of each is, eyesinger, earsinger, headsinger, sweet
singer, nightsinger, parlorsinger, lovesinger, weirdsinger,
or something else.

All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,
The words of true poems do not merely please,
The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters 
of beauty;
The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers 
and fathers,
The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science.

Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health, rudeness 
of body, withdrawnness,
Gayety, suntan, airsweetness, such are some of the words of poems.

The sailor and traveler underlie the makers of poems, the Answerer,
The builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist, all 
these underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer.

The words of the true poems give you more than poems,
They give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war,
peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily life, and every thing 
else,
They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,


                                      



They do not seek beauty, they are sought,
Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing,
fain, lovesick.

They prepare for death, yet are they not the finish, but rather the 
outset,
They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,
Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars,
to learn one of the meanings,
To launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless 
rings and never be quiet again.



OUR OLD FEUILLAGE.

ALWAYS our old feuillage!
Always Florida's green peninsula—always the priceless delta of 
Louisiana—always the cottonfields of Alabama and Texas,
Always California's golden hills and hollows, and the silver moun
tains of New Mexico—always softbreath'd Cuba,
Always the vast slope drain'd by the Southern sea, inseparable with 
the slopes drain'd by the Eastern and Western seas,
The area the eightythird year of these States, the three and a half 
millions of square miles,
The eighteen thousand miles of seacoast and baycoast on the 
main, the thirty thousand miles of river navigation,
The seven millions of distinct families and the same number of 
dwellings—always these, and more, branching forth into 
numberless branches,
Always the free range and diversity—always the continent of 
Democracy;
Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, travelers, Kanada, 
the snows;
Always these compact lands tied at the hips with the belt stringing 
the huge oval lakes;
Always the West with strong native persons, the increasing density 
there, the habitans, friendly, threatening, ironical, scorning 
invaders;
All sights, South, North, East—all deeds, promiscuously done at 
all times,
All characters, movements, growths, a few noticed, myriads unno
ticed,
Through Mannahatta's streets I walking, these things gathering,


                                      



On interior rivers by night in the glare of pine knots, steamboats 
wooding up,
Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the 
valleys of the Potomac and Rappahannock, and the valleys 
of the Roanoke and Delaware,
In their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks 
the hills, or lapping the Saginaw waters to drink,
In a lonesome inlet a sheldrake lost from the flock, sitting on the 
water rocking silently,
In farmers' barns oxen in the stable, their harvest labor done, they 
rest standing, they are too tired,
Afar on arctic ice the shewalrus lying drowsily while her cubs play 
around,
The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail'd, the farthest polar 
sea, ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the floes,
White drift spooning ahead where the ship in the tempest dashes,
On solid land what is done in cities as the bells strike midnight 
together,
In primitive woods the sounds there also sounding, the howl of the 
wolf, the scream of the panther, and the hoarse bellow of 
the elk,
In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead lake, in summer 
visible through the clear waters, the great trout swimming,
In lower latitudes in warmer air in the Carolinas the large black 
buzzard floating slowly high beyond the tree tops,
Below, the red cedar festoon'd with tylandria, the pines and 
cypresses growing out of the white sand that spreads far 
and flat,
Rude boats descending the big Pedee, climbing plants, parasites 
with color'd flowers and berries enveloping huge trees,
The waving drapery on the liveoak trailing long and low, noise
lessly waved by the wind,
The camp of Georgia wagoners just after dark, the supperfires 
and the cooking and eating by whites and negroes,
Thirty or forty great wagons, the mules, cattle, horses, feeding 
from troughs,
The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore
trees, the flames with the black smoke from the pitchpine 
curling and rising;
Southern fishermen fishing, the sounds and inlets of North Caro
lina's coast, the shadfishery and the herringfishery, the 
large sweepseines, the windlasses on shore work'd by 
horses, the clearing, curing, and packinghouses;
Deep in the forest in piney woods turpentine dropping from the 
incisions in the trees, there are the turpentine works,


                                      



There are the negroes at work in good health, the ground in all 
directions is cover'd with pine straw;
In Tennessee and Kentucky slaves busy in the coalings, at the 
forge, by the furnaceblaze, or at the cornshucking,
In Virginia, the planter's son returning after a long absence, joy
fully welcom'd and kiss'd by the aged mulatto nurse,
On rivers boatmen safely moor'd at nightfall in their boats under 
shelter of high banks,
Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the banjo or 
fiddle, others sit on the gunwale smoking and talking;
Late in the afternoon the mockingbird, the American mimic, 
singing in the Great Dismal Swamp,
There are the greenish waters, the resinous odor, the plenteous 
moss, the cypresstree, and the junipertree;
Northward, young men of Mannahatta, the target company from 
an excursion returning home at evening, the musketmuz
zles all bear bunches of flowers presented by women;
Children at play, or on his father's lap a young boy fallen asleep, 
(how his lips move! how he smiles in his sleep!)
The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the Missis
sippi, he ascends a knoll and sweeps his eyes around;
California life, the miner, bearded, dress'd in his rude costume, 
the stanch California friendship, the sweet air, the graves 
one in passing meets solitary just aside the horsepath;
Down in Texas the cottonfield, the negrocabins, drivers driving 
mules or oxen before rude carts, cotton bales piled on 
banks and wharves;
Encircling all, vastdarting up and wide, the American Soul, with 
equal hemispheres, one Love, one Dilation or Pride;
In arriere the peacetalk with the Iroquois the aborigines, the 
calumet, the pipe of goodwill, arbitration, and indorse
ment,
The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then 
toward the earth,
The drama of the scalpdance enacted with painted faces and 
guttural exclamations,
The setting out of the warparty, the long and stealthy march,
The single file, the swinging hatchets, the surprise and slaughter 
of enemies;
All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of these States, 
reminiscences, institutions,
All these States compact, every square mile of these States without 
excepting a particle;
Me pleas'd, rambling in lanes and country fields, Paumanok's 
fields,


                                      



Observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies shuffling 
between each other, ascending high in the air,
The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects, the fall traveler 
southward but returning northward early in the spring,
The country boy at the close of the day driving the herd of cows 
and shouting to them as they loiter to browse by the road
side,
The city wharf, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New 
Orleans, San Francisco,
The departing ships when the sailors heave at the capstan;
Evening—me in my room—the setting sun,
The setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the 
swarm of flies, suspended, balancing in the air in the centre 
of the room, darting athwart, up and down, casting swift 
shadows in specks on the opposite wall where the shine is;
The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of 
listeners,
Males, females, immigrants, combinations, the copiousness, the 
individuality of the States, each for itself—the money
makers,
Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces, the windlass, lever, 
pulley, all certainties,
The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity,
In space the sporades, the scatter'd islands, the stars—on the 
firm earth, the lands, my lands,
O lands! all so dear to me—what you are, (whatever it is,) I 
putting it at random in these songs, become a part of that, 
whatever it is,
Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow flapping, with the 
myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida,
Otherways there atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio 
Grande, the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red 
River, the Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with the spring 
waters laughing and skipping and running,
Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I 
with parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek 
worms and aquatic plants,
Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the kingbird, from piercing 
the crow with its bill, for amusement—and I triumphantly 
twittering,
The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh 
themselves, the body of the flock feed, the sentinels out
side move around with erect heads watching, and are from 
time to time reliev'd by other sentinels—and I feeding 
and taking turns with the rest,


                                      



In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by 
hunters, rising desperately on his hindfeet, and plunging 
with his forefeet, the hoofs as sharp as knives—and I, 
plunging at the hunters, corner'd and desperate,
In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, storehouses, and the 
countless workmen working in the shops,
And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof—and no less in 
myself than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself,
Singing the song of These, my everunited lands—my body no 
more inevitably united, part to part, and made out of a 
thousand diverse contributions one identity, any more than 
my lands are inevitably united and made ONE IDENTITY;
Nativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral Plains,
Cities, labors, death, animals, products, war, good and evil—
these me,
These affording, in all their particulars, the old feuillage to me 
and to America, how can I do less than pass the clew of 
the union of them, to afford the like to you?
Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you 
also be eligible as I am?
How can I but as here chanting, invite you for yourself to collect 
bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States?


A SONG OF JOYS.

O TO make the most jubilant song!
Full of music—full of manhood, womanhood, infancy!
Full of common employments—full of grain and trees.

O for the voices of animals—O for the swiftness and balance of 
fishes!
O for the dropping of raindrops in a song!
O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song!

O the joy of my spirit—it is uncaged—it darts like lightning!
It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time,
I will have thousands of globes and all time.

O the engineer's joys! to go with a locomotive!
To hear the hiss of steam, the merry shriek, the steamwhistle, the 
laughing locomotive!
To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance.



                                      



O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides!
The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds, the moist fresh 
stillness of the woods,
The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak, and all through the 
forenoon.

O the horseman's and horsewoman's joys!
The saddle, the gallop, the pressure upon the seat, the cool gurgling 
by the ears and hair.

O the fireman's joys!
I hear the alarm at dead of night,
I hear bells, shouts! I pass the crowd, I run!
The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure.

O the joy of the strongbrawn'd fighter, towering in the arena in 
perfect condition, conscious of power, thirsting to meet his 
opponent.

O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human 
soul is capable of generating and emitting in steady and 
limitless floods.

O the mother's joys!
The watching, the endurance, the precious love, the anguish, the 
patiently yielded life.

O the joy of increase, growth, recuperation,
The joy of soothing and pacifying, the joy of concord and harmony.

O to go back to the place where I was born,
To hear the birds sing once more,
To ramble about the house and barn and over the fields once more,
And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more.

O to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the 
coast,
To continue and be employ'd there all my life,
The briny and damp smell, the shore, the salt weeds exposed at 
low water,
The work of fishermen, the work of the eelfisher and clamfisher;
I come with my clamrake and spade, I come with my eelspear,
Is the tide out? I join the group of clamdiggers on the flats,
I laugh and work with them, I joke at my work like a mettlesome 
young man;


                                      



In winter I take my eelbasket and eelspear and travel out on foot 
on the ice—I have a small axe to cut holes in the ice,
Behold me wellclothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon, 
my brood of tough boys accompanying me,
My brood of grown and partgrown boys, who love to be with no 
one else so well as they love to be with me,
By day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me.

Another time in warm weather out in a boat, to lift the lobsterpots 
where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I know the 
buoys,)
O the sweetness of the Fifthmonth morning upon the water as I 
row just before sunrise toward the buoys,
I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are 
desperate with their claws as I take them out, I insert 
wooden pegs in the joints of their pincers,
I go to all the places one after another, and then row back to the 
shore,
There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boil'd 
till their color becomes scarlet.

Another time mackereltaking,
Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill the 
water for miles;
Another time fishing for rockfish in Chesapeake bay, I one of the 
brownfaced crew;
Another time trailing for bluefish off Paumanok, I stand with 
braced body,
My left foot is on the gunwale, my right arm throws far out the 
coils of slender rope,
In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs, 
my companions.

O boating on the rivers,
The voyage down the St. Lawrence, the superb scenery, the 
steamers,
The ships sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timberraft 
and the raftsmen with longreaching sweepoars,
The little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they 
cook supper at evening.

(O something pernicious and dread!
Something far away from a puny and pious life!
Something unproved! something in a trance!
Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)



                                      



O to work in mines, or forging iron,
Foundry casting, the foundry itself, the rude high roof, the ample 
and shadow'd space,
The furnace, the hot liquid pour'd out and running.

O to resume the joys of the soldier!
To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer—to feel his 
sympathy!
To behold his calmness—to be warm'd in the rays of his smile!
To go to battle—to hear the bugles play and the drums beat!
To hear the crash of artillery—to see the glittering of the bayonets 
and musketbarrels in the sun!
To see men fall and die and not complain!
To taste the savage taste of blood—to be so devilish!
To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.

O the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my old cruise again!
I feel the ship's motion under me, I feel the Atlantic breezes fan
ning me,
I hear the cry again sent down from the masthead, There—she 
blows!
Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest—we descend, 
wild with excitement,
I leap in the lower'd boat, we row toward our prey where he lies,
We approach stealthy and silent, I see the mountainous mass, 
lethargic, basking,
I see the harpooneer standing up, I see the weapon dart from his 
vigorous arm;
O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale, settling, 
running to windward, tows me,
Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close again,
I see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd in 
the wound,
Again we back off, I see him settle again, the life is leaving him 
fast,
As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim in circles narrower 
and narrower, swiftly cutting the water—I see him die,
He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then 
falls flat and still in the bloody foam.

O the old manhood of me, my noblest joy of all!
My children and grandchildren, my white hair and beard,
My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life.

O ripen'd joy of womanhood! O happiness at last!


                                      



I am more than eighty years of age, I am the most venerable 
mother,
How clear is my mind—how all people draw nigh to me!
What attractions are these beyond any before? what bloom more 
than the bloom of youth?
What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me?

O the orator's joys!
To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from the 
ribs and throat,
To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,
To lead America—to quell America with a great tongue.

O the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself, receiving identity 
through materials and loving them, observing characters 
and absorbing them,
My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing, touch, 
reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like,
The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh,
My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,
Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes 
which finally see,
Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts, 
embraces, procreates.

O the farmer's joys!
Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's, Kan
sian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys!
To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work,
To plough land in the fall for wintersown crops,
To plough land in the spring for maize,
To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in the fall.

O to bathe in the swimmingbath, or in a good place along shore,
To splash the water! to walk ankledeep, or race naked along the 
shore.

O to realize space!
The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,
To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying 
clouds, as one with them.

O the joy of a manly selfhood!
To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant known 
or unknown,


                                      



To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,
To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,
To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,
To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the 
earth.

Know'st thou the excellent joys of youth?
Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing 
face?
Joy of the glad lightbeaming day, joy of the widebreath'd games?
Joy of sweet music, joy of the lighted ballroom and the dancers?
Joy of the plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?

Yet O my soul supreme!
Know'st thou the joys of pensive thought?
Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?
Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow'd yet proud, the suffering 
and the struggle?
The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings day 
or night?
Joys of the thought of Death, the great spheres Time and Space?
Prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals, the divine wife, the 
sweet, eternal, perfect comrade?
Joys all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.

O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave,
To meet life as a powerful conqueror,
No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,
To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground, proving 
my interior soul impregnable,
And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.

For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating—the joy of death!
The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few 
moments, for reasons,
Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd, or 
render'd to powder, or buried,
My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,
My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications, 
further offices, eternal uses of the earth.

O to attract by more than attraction!
How it is I know not—yet behold! the something which obeys 
none of the rest,
It is offensive, never defensive—yet how magnetic it draws.



                                      



O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!
To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!
To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!
To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns with 
perfect nonchalance!
To be indeed a God!

O to sail to sea in a ship!
To leave this steady unendurable land,
To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and 
the houses,
To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,
To sail and sail and sail!

O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys!
To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on!
To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports,
A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)
A swift and swelling ship full of rich words, full of joys.


SONG OF THE BROADAXE.



WEAPON shapely, naked, wan,
Head from the mother's bowels drawn,
Wooded flesh and metal bone, limb only one and lip only one,
Grayblue leaf by redheat grown, helve produced from a little 
seed sown,
Resting the grass amid and upon,
To be lean'd and to lean on.

Strong shapes and attributes of strong shapes, masculine trades,
sights and sounds,
Long varied train of an emblem, dabs of music,
Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the 
great organ.




Welcome are all earth's lands, each for its kind,
Welcome are lands of pine and oak,
Welcome are lands of the lemon and fig,
Welcome are lands of gold,


                                      



Welcome are lands of wheat and maize, welcome those of the 
grape,
Welcome are lands of sugar and rice,
Welcome the cottonlands, welcome those of the white potato 
and sweet potato,
Welcome are mountains, flats, sands, forests, prairies,
Welcome the rich borders of rivers, tablelands, openings,
Welcome the measureless grazinglands, welcome the teeming soil 
of orchards, flax, honey, hemp;
Welcome just as much the other more hardfaced lands,
Lands rich as lands of gold or wheat and fruit lands,
Lands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores,
Lands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc,
Lands of iron—lands of the make of the axe.




The log at the woodpile, the axe supported by it,
The sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space clear'd for a 
garden,
The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves after the storm 
is lull'd,
The wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,
The thought of ships struck in the storm and put on their beam 
ends, and the cutting away of masts,
The sentiment of the huge timbers of oldfashion'd houses and 
barns,
The remember'd print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of 
men, families, goods,
The disembarkation, the founding of a new city,
The voyage of those who sought a New England and found it, the 
outset anywhere,
The settlements of the Arkansas, Colorado, Ottawa, Willamette,
The slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle, saddlebags;
The beauty of all adventurous and daring persons,
The beauty of woodboys and woodmen with their clear un
trimm'd faces,
The beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on 
themselves,
The American contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the bound
less impatience of restraint,
The loose drift of character, the inkling through random types,
the solidification;
The butcher in the slaughterhouse, the hands aboard schooners 
and sloops, the raftsman, the pioneer,


                                      



Lumbermen in their winter camp, daybreak in the woods, stripes 
of snow on the limbs of trees, the occasional snapping,
The glad clear sound of one's own voice, the merry song, the 
natural life of the woods, the strong day's work,
The blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the 
bed of hemlockboughs and the bearskin;
The housebuilder at work in cities or anywhere,
The preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mortising,
The hoistup of beams, the push of them in their places, laying 
them regular,
Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises according as they 
were prepared,
The blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men,
their curv'd limbs,
Bending, standing, astride the beams, driving in pins, holding on 
by posts and braces,
The hook'd arm over the plate, the other arm wielding the axe,
The floormen forcing the planks close to be nail'd,
Their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers,
The echoes resounding through the vacant building;
The huge storehouse carried up in the city well under way,
The six framingmen, two in the middle and two at each end,
carefully bearing on their shoulders a heavy stick for a 
crossbeam,
The crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands 
rapidly laying the long sidewall, two hundred feet from 
front to rear,
The flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the 
trowels striking the bricks,
The bricks one after another each laid so workmanlike in its 
place, and set with a knock of the trowelhandle,
The piles of materials, the mortar on the mortarboards, and the 
steady replenishing by the hodmen;
Sparmakers in the sparyard, the swarming row of wellgrown 
apprentices,
The swing of their axes on the squarehew'd log shaping it toward 
the shape of a mast,
The brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine,
The buttercolor'd chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,
The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy cos
tumes,
The constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulkheads, floats,
stays against the sea;
The city fireman, the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the close
pack'd square,


                                      



The arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and 
daring,
The strong command through the firetrumpets, the falling in line,
the rise and fall of the arms forcing the water,
The slender, spasmic, bluewhite jets, the bringing to bear of the 
hooks and ladders and their execution,
The crash and cut away of connecting woodwork, or through 
floors if the fire smoulders under them,
The crowd with their lit faces watching, the glare and dense 
shadows;
The forger at his forgefurnace and the user of iron after him,
The maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and tem
perer,
The chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel and trying the 
edge with his thumb,
The one who cleanshapes the handle and sets it firmly in the 
socket;
The shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,
The primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers,
The faroff Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice,
The Roman lictors preceding the consuls,
The antique European warrior with his axe in combat,
The uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,
The deathhowl, the limpsy tumbling body, the rush of friend and 
foe thither,
The siege of revolted lieges determin'd for liberty,
The summons to surrender, the battering at castle gates, the truce 
and parley,
The sack of an old city in its time,
The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and 
disorderly,
Roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,
Goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in 
the gripe of brigands,
Craft and thievery of campfollowers, men running, old persons 
despairing,
The hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,
The list of all executive deeds and words just or unjust,
The power of personality just or unjust.




Muscle and pluck forever!
What invigorates life invigorates death,
And the dead advance as much as the living advance,
And the future is no more uncertain than the present,


                                      



For the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as much as 
the delicatesse of the earth and of man,
And nothing endures but personal qualities.

What do you think endures?
Do you think a great city endures?
Or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution? or 
the best built steamships?
Or hotels of granite and iron? or any chefd'oeuvres of engineering,
forts, armaments?

Away! these are not to be cherish'd for themselves,
They fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play for 
them,
The show passes, all does well enough of course,
All does very well till one flash of defiance.

A great city is that which has the greatest men and women,
If it be a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the whole 
world.




The place where a great city stands is not the place of stretch'd 
wharves, docks, manufactures, deposits of produce merely,
Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of newcomers or the anchor
lifters of the departing,
Nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops selling 
goods from the rest of the earth,
Nor the place of the best libraries and schools, nor the place where 
money is plentiest,
Nor the place of the most numerous population.

Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and 
bards,
Where the city stands that is belov'd by these, and loves them in 
return and understands them,
Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words 
and deeds,
Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place,
Where the men and women think lightly of the laws,
Where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases,
Where the populace rise at once against the neverending audacity 
of elected persons,
Where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the whistle 
of death pours its sweeping and unript waves,


                                      



Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of 
inside authority,
Where the citizen is always the head and ideal, and President,
Mayor, Governor and what not, are agents for pay,
Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend 
on themselves,
Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs,
Where speculations on the soul are encouraged,
Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same 
as the men,
Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as 
the men;
Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands,
Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands,
Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands,
Where the city of the bestbodied mothers stands,
There the great city stands.




How beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed!
How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a man's 
or woman's look!

All waits or goes by default till a strong being appears;
A strong being is the proof of the race and of the ability of the 
universe,
When he or she appears materials are overaw'd,
The dispute on the soul stops,
The old customs and phrases are confronted, turn'd back, or laid 
away.

What is your moneymaking now? what can it do now?
What is your respectability now?
What are your theology, tuition, society, traditions, statutebooks,
now?
Where are your jibes of being now?
Where are your cavils about the soul now?




A sterile landscape covers the ore, there is as good as the best for 
all the forbidding appearance,
There is the mine, there are the miners,
The forgefurnace is there, the melt is accomplish'd, the hammers
men are at hand with their tongs and hammers,
What always served and always serves is at hand.



                                      



Than this nothing has better served, it has served all,
Served the fluenttongued and subtlesensed Greek, and long ere 
the Greek,
Served in building the buildings that last longer than any,
Served the Hebrew, the Persian, the most ancient Hindustanee,
Served the moundraiser on the Mississippi, served those whose 
relics remain in Central America,
Served Albic temples in woods or on plains, with unhewn pillars 
and the druids,
Served the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the snowcover'd 
hills of Scandinavia,
Served those who time out of mind made on the granite walls 
rough sketches of the sun, moon, stars, ships, ocean waves,
Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths, served the pas
toral tribes and nomads,
Served the long distant Kelt, served the hardy pirates of the Baltic,
Served before any of those the venerable and harmless men of 
Ethiopia,
Served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure and the 
making of those for war,
Served all great works on land and all great works on the sea,
For the mediaeval ages and before the mediaeval ages,
Served not the living only then as now, but served the dead.




I see the European headsman,
He stands mask'd, clothed in red, with huge legs and strong naked 
arms,
And leans on a ponderous axe.

(Whom have you slaughter'd lately European headsman?
Whose is that blood upon you so wet and sticky?)

I see the clear sunsets of the martyrs,
I see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,
Ghosts of dead lords, uncrown'd ladies, impeach'd ministers,
rejected kings,
Rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains and the rest.

I see those who in any land have died for the good cause,
The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out,
(Mind you O foreign kings, O priests, the crop shall never run out.)

I see the blood wash'd entirely away from the axe,
Both blade and helve are clean,


                                      



They spirt no more the blood of European nobles, they clasp no 
more the necks of queens.

I see the headsman withdraw and become useless,
I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy, I see no longer any axe 
upon it,
I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own 
race, the newest, largest race.




(America! I do not vaunt my love for you,
I have what I have.)

The axe leaps!
The solid forest gives fluid utterances,
They tumble forth, they rise and form,
Hut, tent, landing, survey,
Flail, plough, pick, crowbar, spade,
Shingle, rail, prop, wainscot, jamb, lath, panel, gable,
Citadel, ceiling, saloon, academy, organ, exhibitionhouse, li
brary,
Cornice, trellis, pilaster, balcony, window, turret, porch,
Hoe, rake, pitchfork, pencil, wagon, staff, saw, jackplane, mallet,
wedge, rounce,
Chair, tub, hoop, table, wicket, vane, sash, floor,
Workbox, chest, string'd instrument, boat, frame, and what not,
Capitols of States, and capitol of the nation of States,
Long stately rows in avenues, hospitals for orphans or for the poor 
or sick,
Manhattan steamboats and clippers taking the measure of all seas.

The shapes arise!
Shapes of the using of axes anyhow, and the users and all that 
neighbors them,
Cutters down of wood and haulers of it to the Penobscot or Ken
nebec,
Dwellers in cabins among the Californian mountains or by the little 
lakes, or on the Columbia,
Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio Grande, friendly 
gatherings, the characters and fun,
Dwellers along the St. Lawrence, or north in Kanada, or down by 
the Yellowstone, dwellers on coasts and off coasts,
Sealfishers, whalers, arctic seamen breaking passages through the 
ice.



                                      



The shapes arise!
Shapes of factories, arsenals, foundries, markets,
Shapes of the twothreaded tracks of railroads,
Shapes of the sleepers of bridges, vast frameworks, girders, arches,
Shapes of the fleets of barges, tows, lake and canal craft, river craft,
Shipyards and drydocks along the Eastern and Western seas, and 
in many a bay and byplace,
The liveoak kelsons, the pine planks, the spars, the hackmatack
roots for knees,
The ships themselves on their ways, the tiers of scaffolds, the 
workmen busy outside and inside,
The tools lying around, the great auger and little auger, the adze,
bolt, line, square, gouge, and beadplane.




The shapes arise!
The shape measur'd, saw'd, jack'd, join'd, stain'd,
The coffinshape for the dead to lie within in his shroud,
The shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts, in the posts of 
the bride's bed,
The shape of the little trough, the shape of the rockers beneath,
the shape of the babe's cradle,
The shape of the floorplanks, the floorplanks for dancers' feet,
The shape of the planks of the family home, the home of the 
friendly parents and children,
The shape of the roof of the home of the happy young man and 
woman, the roof over the wellmarried young man and 
woman,
The roof over the supper joyously cook'd by the chaste wife, and 
joyously eaten by the chaste husband, content after his 
day's work.

The shapes arise!
The shape of the prisoner's place in the courtroom, and of him 
or her seated in the place,
The shape of the liquorbar lean'd against by the young rum
drinker and the old rumdrinker,
The shape of the shamed and angry stairs trod by sneaking foot
steps,
The shape of the sly settee, and the adulterous unwholesome 
couple,
The shape of the gamblingboard with its devilish winnings and 
losings,
The shape of the stepladder for the convicted and sentenced 
murderer, the murderer with haggard face and pinion'd arms,


                                      



The sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent and whitelipp'd 
crowd, the dangling of the rope.

The shapes arise!
Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances,
The door passing the dissever'd friend flush'd and in haste,
The door that admits good news and bad news,
The door whence the son left home confident and puff'd up,
The door he enter'd again from a long and scandalous absence,
diseas'd, broken down, without innocence, without means.




Her shape arises,
She less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever,
The gross and soil'd she moves among do not make her gross and 
soil'd,
She knows the thoughts as she passes, nothing is conceal'd from her,
She is none the less considerate or friendly therefor,
She is the best belov'd, it is without exception, she has no reason 
to fear and she does not fear,
Oaths, quarrels, hiccupp'd songs, smutty expressions, are idle to 
her as she passes,
She is silent, she is possess'd of herself, they do not offend her,
She receives them as the laws of Nature receive them, she is strong,
She too is a law of Nature—there is no law stronger than she is.




The main shapes arise!
Shapes of Democracy total, result of centuries,
Shapes ever projecting other shapes,
Shapes of turbulent manly cities,
Shapes of the friends and homegivers of the whole earth,
Shapes bracing the earth and braced with the whole earth.



SONG OF THE EXPOSITION.



(AH little recks the laborer,
How near his work is holding him to God,
The loving Laborer through space and time.)

After all not to create only, or found only,


                                      



But to bring perhaps from afar what is already founded,
To give it our own identity, average, limitless, free,
To fill the gross the torpid bulk with vital religious fire,
Not to repel or destroy so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate,
To obey as well as command, to follow more than to lead,
These also are the lessons of our New World;
While how little the New after all, how much the Old, Old World!

Long and long has the grass been growing,
Long and long has the rain been falling,
Long has the globe been rolling round.




Come Muse migrate from Greece and Ionia,
Cross out please those immensely overpaid accounts,
That matter of Troy and Achilles' wrath, and Aeneas', Odysseus'
wanderings,
Placard "Removed" and "To Let" on the rocks of your snowy 
Parnassus,
Repeat at Jerusalem, place the notice high on Jaffa's gate and on 
Mount Moriah,
The same on the walls of your German, French and Spanish 
castles, and Italian collections,
For know a better, fresher, busier sphere, a wide, untried domain 
awaits, demands you.




Responsive to our summons,
Or rather to her longnurs'd inclination,
Join'd with an irresistible, natural gravitation,
She comes! I hear the rustling of her gown,
I scent the odor of her breath's delicious fragrance,
I mark her step divine, her curious eyes aturning, rolling,
Upon this very scene.

The dame of dames! can I believe then,
Those ancient temples, sculptures classic, could none of them 
retain her?
Nor shades of Virgil and Dante, nor myriad memories, poems,
old associations, magnetize and hold on to her?
But that she's left them all—and here?

Yes, if you will allow me to say so,
I, my friends, if you do not, can plainly see her,


                                      



The same undying soul of earth's, activity's, beauty's, heroism's 
expression,
Out from her evolutions hither come, ended the strata of her 
former themes,
Hidden and cover'd by today's, foundation of today's,
Ended, deceas'd through time, her voice by Castaly's fountain,
Silent the brokenlipp'd Sphynx in Egypt, silent all those century
baffling tombs,
Ended for aye the epics of Asia's, Europe's helmeted warriors,
ended the primitive call of the muses,
Calliope's call forever closed, Clio, Melpomene, Thalia dead,
Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana, ended the quest 
of the holy Graal,
Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind, extinct,
The Crusaders' streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the 
sunrise,
Amadis, Tancred, utterly gone, Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver gone,
Palmerin, ogre, departed, vanish'd the turrets that Usk from its 
waters reflected,
Arthur vanish'd with all his knights, Merlin and Lancelot and 
Galahad, all gone, dissolv'd utterly like an exhalation;
Pass'd! pass'd! for us, forever pass'd, that once so mighty world,
now void, inanimate, phantom world,
Embroider'd, dazzling, foreign world, with all its gorgeous legends,
myths,
Its kings and castles proud, its priests and warlike lords and 
courtly dames,
Pass'd to its charnel vault, coffin'd with crown and armor on,
Blazon'd with Shakspere's purple page,
And dirged by Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme.

I say I see, my friends, if you do not, the illustrious emigré,
(having it is true in her day, although the same, changed,
journey'd considerable,)
Making directly for this rendezvous, vigorously clearing a path for 
herself, striding through the confusion,
By thud of machinery and shrill steamwhistle undismay'd,
Bluff'd not a bit by drainpipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers,
Smiling and pleas'd with palpable intent to stay,
She's here, install'd amid the kitchen ware!




But hold—don't I forget my manners?
To introduce the stranger, (what else indeed do I live to chant 
for?) to thee Columbia;


                                      



In liberty's name welcome immortal! clasp hands,
And ever henceforth sisters dear be both.

Fear not O Muse! truly new ways and days receive, surround you,
I candidly confess a queer, queer race, of novel fashion,
And yet the same old human race, the same within, without,
Faces and hearts the same, feelings the same, yearnings the same,
The same old love, beauty and use the same.




We do not blame thee elder World, nor really separate ourselves 
from thee,
(Would the son separate himself from the father?)
Looking back on thee, seeing thee to thy duties, grandeurs,
through past ages bending, building,
We build to ours today.

Mightier than Egypt's tombs,
Fairer than Grecia's, Roma's temples,
Prouder than Milan's statued, spired cathedral,
More picturesque than Rhenish castlekeeps,
We plan even now to raise, beyond them all,
Thy great cathedral sacred industry, no tomb,
A keep for life for practical invention.

As in a waking vision,
E'en while I chant I see it rise, I scan and prophesy outside 
and in,
Its manifold ensemble.

Around a palace, loftier, fairer, ampler than any yet,
Earth's modern wonder, history's seven outstripping,
High rising tier on tier with glass and iron façades,
Gladdening the sun and sky, enhued in cheerfulest hues,
Bronze, lilac, robin'segg, marine and crimson,
Over whose golden roof shall flaunt, beneath thy banner Freedom,
The banners of the States and flags of every land,
A brood of lofty, fair, but lesser palaces shall cluster.

Somewhere within their walls shall all that forwards perfect human 
life be started,
Tried, taught, advanced, visibly exhibited.

Not only all the world of works, trade, products,
But all the workmen of the world here to be represented.



                                      



Here shall you trace in flowing operation,
In every state of practical, busy movement, the rills of civilization,
Materials here under your eye shall change their shape as if by 
magic,
The cotton shall be pick'd almost in the very field,
Shall be dried, clean'd, ginn'd, baled, spun into thread and cloth 
before you,
You shall see hands at work at all the old processes and all the 
new ones,
You shall see the various grains and how flour is made and then 
bread baked by the bakers,
You shall see the crude ores of California and Nevada passing on 
and on till they become bullion,
You shall watch how the printer sets type, and learn what a com
posingstick is,
You shall mark in amazement the Hoe press whirling its cylinders,
shedding the printed leaves steady and fast,
The photograph, model, watch, pin, nail, shall be created before 
you.

In large calm halls, a stately museum shall teach you the infinite 
lessons of minerals,
In another, woods, plants, vegetation shall be illustrated—in 
another animals, animal life and development.

One stately house shall be the music house,
Others for other arts—learning, the sciences, shall all be here,
None shall be slighted, none but shall here be honor'd, help'd,
exampled.




(This, this and these, America, shall be your pyramids and 
obelisks,
Your Alexandrian Pharos, gardens of Babylon,
Your temple at Olympia.)

The male and female many laboring not,
Shall ever here confront the laboring many,
With precious benefits to both, glory to all,
To thee America, and thee eternal Muse.

And here shall ye inhabit powerful Matrons!
In your vast state vaster than all the old,
Echoed through long, long centuries to come,
To sound of different, prouder songs, with stronger themes,


                                      



Practical, peaceful life, the people's life, the People themselves,
Lifted, illumin'd, bathed in peace—elate, secure in peace.




Away with themes of war! away with war itself!
Hence from my shuddering sight to never more return that show 
of blacken'd, mutilated corpses!
That hell unpent and raid of blood, fit for wild tigers or for lop
tongued wolves, not reasoning men,
And in its stead speed industry's campaigns,
With thy undaunted armies, engineering,
Thy pennants labor, loosen'd to the breeze,
Thy bugles sounding loud and clear.

Away with old romance!
Away with novels, plots and plays of foreign courts,
Away with loveverses sugar'd in rhyme, the intrigues, amours of 
idlers,
Fitted for only banquets of the night where dancers to late music 
slide,
The unhealthy pleasures, extravagant dissipations of the few,
With perfumes, heat and wine, beneath the dazzling chandeliers.

To you ye reverent sane sisters,
I raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for art,
To exalt the present and the real,
To teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and trade,
To sing in songs how exercise and chemical life are never to be 
baffled,
To manual work for each and all, to plough, hoe, dig,
To plant and tend the tree, the berry, vegetables, flowers,
For every man to see to it that he really do something, for every 
woman too;
To use the hammer and the saw, (rip, or crosscut,)
To cultivate a turn for carpentering, plastering, painting,
To work as tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, porter,
To invent a little, something ingenious, to aid the washing, cook
ing, cleaning,
And hold it no disgrace to take a hand at them themselves.

I say I bring thee Muse today and here,
All occupations, duties broad and close,
Toil, healthy toil and sweat, endless, without cessation,
The old, old practical burdens, interests, joys,


                                      



The family, parentage, childhood, husband and wife,
The housecomforts, the house itself and all its belongings,
Food and its preservation, chemistry applied to it,
Whatever forms the average, strong, complete, sweetblooded man 
or woman, the perfect longeve personality,
And helps its present life to health and happiness, and shapes its soul,
For the eternal real life to come.

With latest connections, works, the intertransportation of the world,
Steampower, the great express lines, gas, petroleum,
These triumphs of our time, the Atlantic's delicate cable,
The Pacific railroad, the Suez canal, the Mont Cenis and Gothard 
and Hoosac tunnels, the Brooklyn bridge,
This earth all spann'd with iron rails, with lines of steamships 
threading every sea,
Our own rondure, the current globe I bring.




And thou America,
Thy offspring towering e'er so high, yet higher Thee above all 
towering,
With Victory on thy left, and at thy right hand Law;
Thou Union holding all, fusing, absorbing, tolerating all,
Thee, ever thee, I sing.

Thou, also thou, a World,
With all thy wide geographies, manifold, different, distant,
Rounded by thee in one—one common orbic language,
One common indivisible destiny for All.

And by the spells which ye vouchsafe to those your ministers in 
earnest,
I here personify and call my themes, to make them pass before ye.

Behold, America! (and thou, ineffable guest and sister!)
For thee come trooping up thy waters and thy lands;
Behold! thy fields and farms, thy faroff woods and mountains,
As in procession coming.

Behold, the sea itself,
And on its limitless, heaving breast, the ships;
See, where their white sails, bellying in the wind, speckle the green 
and blue,
See, the steamers coming and going, steaming in or out of port,
See, dusky and undulating, the long pennants of smoke.



                                      



Behold, in Oregon, far in the north and west,
Or in Maine, far in the north and east, thy cheerful axemen,
Wielding all day their axes.

Behold, on the lakes, thy pilots at their wheels, thy oarsmen,
How the ash writhes under those muscular arms!

There by the furnace, and there by the anvil,
Behold thy sturdy blacksmiths swinging their sledges,
Overhand so steady, overhand they turn and fall with joyous clank,
Like a tumult of laughter.

Mark the spirit of invention everywhere, thy rapid patents,
Thy continual workshops, foundries, risen or rising,
See, from their chimneys how the tall flamefires stream.

Mark, thy interminable farms, North, South,
Thy wealthy daughterstates, Eastern and Western,
The varied products of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Georgia,
Texas, and the rest,
Thy limitless crops, grass, wheat, sugar, oil, corn, rice, hemp, hops,
Thy barns all fill'd, the endless freighttrain and the bulging 
storehouse,
The grapes that ripen on thy vines, the apples in thy orchards,
Thy incalculable lumber, beef, pork, potatoes, thy coal, thy gold 
and silver,
The inexhaustible iron in thy mines.

All thine O sacred Union!
Ships, farms, shops, barns, factories, mines,
City and State, North, South, item and aggregate,
We dedicate, dread Mother, all to thee!

Protectress absolute, thou! bulwark of all!
For well we know that while thou givest each and all,(generous 
as God,)
Without thee neither all nor each, nor land, home,
Nor ship, nor mine, nor any here this day secure,
Nor aught, nor any day secure.




And thou, the Emblem waving over all!
Delicate beauty, a word to thee, (it may be salutary,)
Remember thou hast not always been as here today so comfortably 
ensovereign'd,


                                      



In other scenes than these have I observ'd thee flag,
Not quite so trim and whole and freshly blooming in folds of stain
less silk,
But I have seen thee bunting, to tatters torn upon thy splinter'd staff,
Or clutch'd to some young colorbearer's breast with desperate hands,
Savagely struggled for, for life or death, fought over long,
'Mid cannons' thundercrash and many a curse and groan and yell,
and riflevolleys cracking sharp,
And moving masses as wild demons surging, and lives as nothing 
risk'd,
For thy mere remnant grimed with dirt and smoke and sopp'd in 
blood,
For sake of that, my beauty, and that thou might'st dally as now 
secure up there,
Many a good man have I seen go under.

Now here and these and hence in peace, all thine O Flag!
And here and hence for thee, O universal Muse! and thou for them!
And here and hence O Union, all the work and workmen thine!
None separate from thee—henceforth One only, we and thou,
(For the blood of the children, what is it, only the blood 
maternal?
And lives and works, what are they all at last, except the roads to 
faith and death?)

While we rehearse our measureless wealth, it is for thee, dear 
Mother,
We own it all and several today indissoluble in thee;
Think not our chant, our show, merely for products gross or lucre 
—it is for thee, the soul in thee, electric, spiritual!
Our farms, inventions, crops, we own in thee! cities and States in 
thee!
Our freedom all in thee! our very lives in thee!



SONG OF THE REDWOODTREE.



A CALIFORNIA song,
A prophecy and indirection, a thought impalpable to breathe as air,
A chorus of dryads, fading, departing, or hamadryads departing,
A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,
Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.



                                      



Farewell my brethren,
Farewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters,
My time has ended, my term has come.

Along the northern coast,
Just back from the rockbound shore and the caves,
In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country,
With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse,
With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong 
arms,
Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes, there in the redwood 
forest dense,
I heard the mighty tree its deathchant chanting.

The choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not,
The quickear'd teamsters and chain and jackscrew men heard 
not,
As the woodspirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to 
join the refrain,
But in my soul I plainly heard.

Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,
Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,
Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its footthick bark,
That chant of the seasons and time, chant not of the past only 
but the future.

You untold life of me,
And all you venerable and innocent joys,
Perennial hardy life of me with joys 'mid rain and many a 
summer sun,
And the white snows and night and the wild winds;
O the great patient rugged joys, my soul's strong joys unreck'd by 
man,
(For know I bear the soul befitting me, I too have consciousness, 
identity,
And all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth,)
Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine,
Our time, our term has come.

Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers,
We who have grandly fill'd our time;
With Nature's calm content, with tacit huge delight,
We welcome what we wrought for through the past,
And leave the field for them.



                                      



For them predicted long,
For a superber race, they too to grandly fill their time,
For them we abdicate, in them ourselves ye forest kings!
In them these skies and airs, these mountain peaks, Shasta, 
Nevadas,
These huge precipitous cliffs, this amplitude, these valleys, far 
Yosemite,
To be in them absorb'd, assimilated.

Then to a loftier strain,
Still prouder, more ecstatic rose the chant,
As if the heirs, the deities of the West,
Joining with mastertongue bore part.

Not wan from Asia's fetiches,
Nor red from Europe's old dynastic slaughterhouse,
(Area of murderplots of thrones, with scent left yet of wars and 
scaffolds everywhere,)
But come from Nature's long and harmless throes, peacefully 
builded thence,
These virgin lands, lands of the Western shore,
To the new culminating man, to you, the empire new,
You promis'd long, we pledge, we dedicate.

You occult deep volitions,
You average spiritual manhood, purpose of all, pois'd on yourself, 
giving not taking law,
You womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence life 
and love and aught that comes from life and love,
You unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of America, 
(age upon age working in death the same as life,)
You that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and 
mould the New World, adjusting it to Time and Space,
You hidden national will lying in your abysms, conceal'd but ever 
alert,
You past and present purposes tenaciously pursued, maybe uncon
scious of yourselves,
Unswerv'd by all the passing errors, perturbations of the surface;
You vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds, arts, 
statutes, literatures,
Here build your homes for good, establish here, these areas entire, 
lands of the Western shore,
We pledge, we dedicate to you.

For man of you, your characteristic race,


                                      



Here may he hardy, sweet, gigantic grow, here tower proportion
ate to Nature,
Here climb the vast pure spaces unconfined, uncheck'd by wall or 
roof,
Here laugh with storm or sun, here joy, here patiently inure,
Here heed himself, unfold himself, (not others' formulas heed,) 
here fill his time,
To duly fall, to aid, unreck'd at last,
To disappear, to serve.

Thus on the northern coast,
In the echo of teamsters' calls and the clinking chains, and the 
music of choppers' axes,
The falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek, the 
groan,
Such words combined from the redwoodtree, as of voices ecstatic,
ancient and rustling,
The centurylasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,
All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,
From the Cascade range to the Wahsatch, or Idaho far, or Utah,
To the deities of the modern henceforth yielding,
The chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity, the 
settlements, features all,
In the Mendocino woods I caught.




The flashing and golden pageant of California,
The sudden and gorgeous drama, the sunny and ample lands,
The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado south,
Lands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air, valleys and mountain 
cliffs,
The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow, the silent, cyclic 
chemistry,
The slow and steady ages plodding, the unoccupied surface ripen
ing, the rich ores forming beneath;
At last the New arriving, assuming, taking possession,
A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere,
Ships coming in from the whole round world, and going out to 
the whole world,
To India and China and Australia and the thousand island para
dises of the Pacific,
Populous cities, the latest inventions, the steamers on the rivers,
the railroads, with many a thrifty farm, with machinery,
And wool and wheat and the grape, and diggings of yellow gold.




                                      





But more in you than these, lands of the Western shore,
(These but the means, the implements, the standingground,)
I see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of years,
till now deferr'd,
Promis'd to be fulfill'd, our common kind, the race.

The new society at last, proportionate to Nature,
In man of you, more than your mountain peaks or stalwart trees 
imperial,
In woman more, far more, than all your gold or vines, or even 
vital air.

Fresh come, to a new world indeed, yet long prepared,
I see the genius of the modern, child of the real and ideal,
Clearing the ground for broad humanity, the true America, heir 
of the past so grand,
To build a grander future.



A SONG FOR OCCUPATIONS.



A SONG for occupations!
In the labor of engines and trades and the labor of fields I find 
the developments,
And find the eternal meanings.

Workmen and Workwomen!
Were all educations practical and ornamental well display'd out 
of me, what would it amount to?
Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise statesman,
what would it amount to?
Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you, would that 
satisfy you?

The learn'd, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms,
A man like me and never the usual terms.

Neither a servant nor a master I,
I take no sooner a large price than a small price, I will have my 
own whoever enjoys me,
I will be even with you and you shall be even with me.



                                      



If you stand at work in a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest in 
the same shop,
If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend I demand as 
good as your brother or dearest friend,
If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, I must 
be personally as welcome,
If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so for your 
sake,
If you remember your foolish and outlaw'd deeds, do you think 
I cannot remember my own foolish and outlaw'd deeds?
If you carouse at the table I carouse at the opposite side of the 
table,
If you meet some stranger in the streets and love him or her, why 
I often meet strangers in the street and love them.

Why what have you thought of yourself?
Is it you then that thought yourself less?
Is it you that thought the President greater than you?
Or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than you?

(Because you are greasy or pimpled, or were once drunk, or a 
thief,
Or that you are diseas'd, or rheumatic, or a prostitute,
Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar and 
never saw your name in print,
Do you give in that you are any less immortal?)




Souls of men and women! it is not you I call unseen, unheard,
untouchable and untouching,
It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to settle whether 
you are alive or no,
I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns.

Grown, halfgrown and babe, of this country and every country, in
doors and outdoors, one just as much as the other, I see,
And all else behind or through them.

The wife, and she is not one jot less than the husband,
The daughter, and she is just as good as the son,
The mother, and she is every bit as much as the father.

Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,
Young fellows working on farms and old fellows working on farms,
Sailormen, merchantmen, coasters, immigrants,


                                      



All these I see, but nigher and farther the same I see,
None shall escape me and none shall wish to escape me.

I bring what you much need yet always have,
Not money, amours, dress, eating, erudition, but as good,
I send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value, but 
offer the value itself.

There is something that comes to one now and perpetually,
It is not what is printed, preach'd, discussed, it eludes discussion 
and print,
It is not to be put in a book, it is not in this book,
It is for you whoever you are, it is no farther from you than your 
hearing and sight are from you,
It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest, it is ever provoked 
by them.

You may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it,
You may read the President's message and read nothing about it 
there,
Nothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury 
department, or in the daily papers or weekly papers,
Or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any 
accounts of stock.




The sun and stars that float in the open air,
The appleshaped earth and we upon it, surely the drift of them 
is something grand,
I do not know what it is except that it is grand, and that it is 
happiness,
And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation or 
bonmot or reconnoissance,
And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for 
us, and without luck must be a failure for us,
And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain 
contingency.

The light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the 
greed that with perfect complaisance devours all things,
The endless pride and outstretching of man, unspeakable joys 
and sorrows,
The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and the 
wonders that fill each minute of time forever,
What have you reckon'd them for, camerado?


                                      



Have you reckon'd them for your trade or farmwork? or for the 
profits of your store?
Or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman's leisure,
or a lady's leisure?

Have you reckon'd that the landscape took substance and form 
that it might be painted in a picture?
Or men and women that they might be written of, and songs sung?
Or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious 
combinations and the fluids of the air, as subjects for the 
savans?
Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?
Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?
Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or agricul
ture itself?

Old institutions, these arts, libraries, legends, collections, and the 
practice handed along in manufactures, will we rate them 
so high?
Will we rate our cash and business high? I have no objection,
I rate them as high as the highest—then a child born of a 
woman and man I rate beyond all rate.

We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution grand,
I do not say they are not grand and good, for they are,
I am this day just as much in love with them as you,
Then I am in love with You, and with all my fellows upon the 
earth.

We consider bibles and religions divine—I do not say they are 
not divine,
I say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you 
still,
It is not they who give the life, it is you who give the life,
Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth,
than they are shed out of you.




The sum of all known reverence I add up in you whoever you are,
The President is there in the White House for you, it is not you 
who are here for him,
The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you, not you here for them,
The Congress convenes every Twelfthmonth for you,
Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of cities, the 
going and coming of commerce and mails, are all for you.



                                      



List close my scholars dear,
Doctrines, politics and civilization exurge from you,
Sculpture and monuments and any thing inscribed anywhere are 
tallied in you,
The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records reach 
is in you this hour, and myths and tales the same,
If you were not breathing and walking here, where would they 
all be?
The most renown'd poems would be ashes, orations and plays 
would be vacuums.

All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it,
(Did you think it was in the white or gray stone? or the lines of 
the arches and cornices?)

All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the 
instruments,
It is not the violins and the cornets, it is not the oboe nor the 
beating drums, nor the score of the baritone singer singing 
his sweet romanza, nor that of the men's chorus, nor that 
of the women's chorus,
It is nearer and farther than they.




Will the whole come back then?
Can each see signs of the best by a look in the lookingglass? is 
there nothing greater or more?
Does all sit there with you, with the mystic unseen soul?

Strange and hard that paradox true I give,
Objects gross and the unseen soul are one.

Housebuilding, measuring, sawing the boards,
Blacksmithing, glassblowing, nailmaking, coopering, tinroofing,
shingledressing,
Shipjoining, dockbuilding, fishcuring, flagging of sidewalks by 
flaggers,
The pump, the piledriver, the great derrick, the coalkiln and 
brickkiln,
Coalmines and all that is down there, the lamps in the darkness,
echoes, songs, what meditations, what vast native thoughts 
looking through smutch'd faces,
Ironworks, forgefires in the mountains or by riverbanks, men 
around feeling the melt with huge crowbars, lumps of ore,
the due combining of ore, limestone, coal,


                                      



The blastfurnace and the puddlingfurnace, the louplump at the 
bottom of the melt at last, the rollingmill, the stumpy 
bars of pigiron, the strong cleanshaped Trail for rail
roads,
Oilworks, silkworks, whiteleadworks, the sugarhouse, steam
saws, the great mills and factories,
Stonecutting, shapely trimmings for façades or window or door
lintels, the mallet, the toothchisel, the jib to protect the 
thumb,
The calkingiron, the kettle of boiling vaultcement, and the fire 
under the kettle,
The cottonbale, the stevedore's hook, the saw and buck of the 
sawyer, the mould of the moulder, the workingknife of 
the butcher, the icesaw, and all the work with ice,
The work and tools of the rigger, grappler, sailmaker, block
maker,
Goods of guttapercha, papiermaché, colors, brushes, brush
making, glazier's implements,
The veneer and gluepot, the confectioner's ornaments, the 
decanter and glasses, the shears and flatiron,
The awl and kneestrap, the pint measure and quart measure, the 
counter and stool, the writingpen of quill or metal, the 
making of all sorts of edged tools,
The brewery, brewing, the malt, the vats, every thing that is done 
by brewers, winemakers, vinegarmakers,
Leatherdressing, coachmaking, boilermaking, ropetwisting, dis
tilling, signpainting, limeburning, cottonpicking, electro
plating, electrotyping, stereotyping,
Stavemachines, planingmachines, reapingmachines, ploughing
machines, thrashingmachines, steam wagons,
The cart of the carman, the omnibus, the ponderous dray,
Pyrotechny, letting off color'd fireworks at night, fancy figures and 
jets;
Beef on the butcher's stall, the slaughterhouse of the butcher, the 
butcher in his killingclothes,
The pens of live pork, the killinghammer, the hoghook, the 
scalder's tub, gutting, the cutter's cleaver, the packer's maul,
and the plenteous winterwork of porkpacking,
Flourworks, grinding of wheat, rye, maize, rice, the barrels and 
the half and quarter barrels, the loaded barges, the high 
piles on wharves and levees,
The men and the work of the men on ferries, railroads, coasters,
fishboats, canals;
The hourly routine of your own or any man's life, the shop, yard,
store, or factory,


                                      



These shows all near you by day and night—workman! whoever 
you are, your daily life!
In that and them the heft of the heaviest—in that and them far 
more than you estimated, (and far less also,)
In them realities for you and me, in them poems for you and me,
In them, not yourself—you and your soul enclose all things, re
gardless of estimation,
In them the development good—in them all themes, hints, possi
bilities.

I do not affirm that what you see beyond is futile, I do not advise 
you to stop,
I do not say leadings you thought great are not great,
But I say that none lead to greater than these lead to.




Will you seek afar off? you surely come back at last,
In things best known to you finding the best, or as good as the 
best,
In folks nearest to you finding the sweetest, strongest, lovingest,
Happiness, knowledge, not in another place but this place, not for 
another hour but this hour,
Man in the first you see or touch, always in friend, brother,
nighest neighbor—woman in mother, sister, wife,
The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in poems 
or anywhere,
You workwomen and workmen of these States having your own 
divine and strong life,
And all else giving place to men and women like you.

When the psalm sings instead of the singer,
When the script preaches instead of the preacher,
When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that 
carved the supporting desk,
When I can touch the body of books by night or by day, and 
when they touch my body back again,
When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman and 
child convince,
When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the nightwatchman's 
daughter,
When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite and are my friendly 
companions,
I intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of them as 
I do of men and women like you.




                                      




A SONG OF THE ROLLING EARTH.



A SONG of the rolling earth, and of words according,
Were you thinking that those were the words, those upright lines?
those curves, angles, dots?
No, those are not the words, the substantial words are in the 
ground and sea,
They are in the air, they are in you.

Were you thinking that those were the words, those delicious sounds 
out of your friends' mouths?
No, the real words are more delicious than they.

Human bodies are words, myriads of words,
(In the best poems reappears the body, man's or woman's, well
shaped, natural, gay,
Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the need of 
shame.)

Air, soil, water, fire—those are words,
I myself am a word with them—my qualities interpenetrate with 
theirs—my name is nothing to them,
Though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would 
air, soil, water, fire, know of my name?

A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words,
sayings, meanings,
The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women,
are sayings and meanings also.

The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the earth,
The masters know the earth's words and use them more than 
audible words.

Amelioration is one of the earth's words,
The earth neither lags nor hastens,
It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump,
It is not half beautiful only, defects and excrescences show just as 
much as perfections show.

The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough,
The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so conceal'd 
either,



                                      



They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print,
They are imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly,
Conveying a sentiment and invitation, I utter and utter,
I speak not, yet if you hear me not of what avail am I to you?
To bear, to better, lacking these of what avail am I?

(Accouche! accouchez!
Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?
Will you squat and stifle there?)

The earth does not argue,
Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,
Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,
Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,
Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,
Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.

The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit itself, pos
sesses still underneath,
Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the 
wail of slaves,
Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young 
people, accents of bargainers,
Underneath these possessing words that never fail.

To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother 
never fail,
The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail and reflection 
does not fail,
Also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we pursue does 
not fail.

Of the interminable sisters,
Of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters,
Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger 
sisters,
The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.

With her ample back towards every beholder,
With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age,
Sits she whom I too love like the rest, sits undisturb'd,
Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror, while 
her eyes glance back from it,
Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,
Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.



                                      



Seen at hand or seen at a distance,
Duly the twentyfour appear in public every day,
Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion,
Looking from no countenances of their own, but from the counte
nances of those who are with them,
From the countenances of children or women or the manly coun
tenance,
From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things,
From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of 
the sky,
From our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning them,
Every day in public appearing without fail, but never twice with 
the same companions.

Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred and 
sixtyfive resistlessly round the sun;
Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred 
and sixtyfive offsets of the first, sure and necessary as they.

Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,
Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding, passing, carrying,
The soul's realization and determination still inheriting,
The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing,
No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking,
Swift, glad, content, unbereav'd, nothing losing,
Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account,
The divine ship sails the divine sea.




Whoever you are! motion and reflection are especially for you,
The divine ship sails the divine sea for you.

Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is solid 
and liquid,
You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky,
For none more than you are the present and the past,
For none more than you is immortality.

Each man to himself and each woman to herself, is the word of 
the past and present, and the true word of immortality;
No one can acquire for another—not one,
Not one can grow for another—not one.

The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him,
The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him,


                                      



The murder is to the murderer, and comes back most to him,
The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him,
The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him,
The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him—it cannot 
fail,
The oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor and actress 
not to the audience,
And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own,
or the indication of his own.




I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall 
be complete,
The earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who 
remains jagged and broken.

I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate 
those of the earth,
There can be no theory of any account unless it corroborate the 
theory of the earth,
No politics, song, religion, behavior, or what not, is of account,
unless it compare with the amplitude of the earth,
Unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, rectitude of the 
earth.

I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which 
responds love,
It is that which contains itself, which never invites and never 
refuses.

I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words,
All merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings 
of the earth,
Toward him who sings the songs of the body and of the truths 
of the earth,
Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print can
not touch.

I swear I see what is better than to tell the best,
It is always to leave the best untold.

When I undertake to tell the best I find I cannot,
My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,
My breath will not be obedient to its organs,
I become a dumb man.



                                      



The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow, all or any is best,
It is not what you anticipated, it is cheaper, easier, nearer,
Things are not dismiss'd from the places they held before,
The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before,
Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real as before,
But the soul is also real, it too is positive and direct,
No reasoning, no proof has establish'd it,
Undeniable growth has establish'd it.




These to echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls,
(If they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they then?
If they had not reference to you in especial what were they then?)

I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells 
the best,
I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold.

Say on, sayers! sing on, singers!
Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!
Work on, age after age, nothing is to be lost,
It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use,
When the materials are all prepared and ready, the architects shall 
appear.

I swear to you the architects shall appear without fail,
I swear to you they will understand you and justify you,
The greatest among them shall be he who best knows you, and 
encloses all and is faithful to all,
He and the rest shall not forget you, they shall perceive that you 
are not an iota less than they,
You shall be fully glorified in them.



YOUTH, DAY, OLD AGE AND NIGHT.

YOUTH, large, lusty, loving—youth full of grace, force, fascination,
Do you know that Old Age may come after you with equal grace, 
force, fascination?

Day fullblown and splendid—day of the immense sun, action, 
ambition, laughter,
The Night follows close with millions of suns, and sleep and 
restoring darkness.



                                      




BIRDS OF PASSAGE.


SONG OF THE UNIVERSAL.



COME said the Muse,
Sing me a song no poet yet has chanted,
Sing me the universal.

In this broad earth of ours,
Amid the measureless grossness and the slag,
Enclosed and safe within its central heart,
Nestles the seed perfection.

By every life a share or more or less,
None born but it is born, conceal'd or unconceal'd the seed is 
waiting.




Lo! keeneyed towering science,
As from tall peaks the modern overlooking,
Successive absolute fiats issuing.

Yet again, lo! the soul, above all science,
For it has history gather'd like husks around the globe,
For it the entire starmyriads roll through the sky.

In spiral routes by long detours,
(As a muchtacking ship upon the sea,)
For it the partial to the permanent flowing,
For it the real to the ideal tends.

For it the mystic evolution,
Not the right only justified, what we call evil also justified.

Forth from their masks, no matter what,
From the huge festering trunk, from craft and guile and tears,
Health to emerge and joy, joy universal.

Out of the bulk, the morbid and the shallow,
Out of the bad majority, the varied countless frauds of men and 
states,
Electric, antiseptic yet, cleaving, suffusing all,
Only the good is universal.




                                      





Over the mountaingrowths disease and sorrow,
An uncaught bird is ever hovering, hovering,
High in the purer, happier air.

From imperfection's murkiest cloud,
Darts always forth one ray of perfect light,
One flash of heaven's glory.

To fashion's, custom's discord,
To the mad Babeldin, the deafening orgies,
Soothing each lull a strain is heard, just heard,
From some far shore the final chorus sounding.

O the blest eyes, the happy hearts,
That see, that know the guiding thread so fine,
Along the mighty labyrinth.




And thou America,
For the scheme's culmination, its thought and its reality,
For these (not for thyself) thou hast arrived.

Thou too surroundest all,
Embracing carrying welcoming all, thou too by pathways broad 
and new,
To the ideal tendest.

The measur'd faiths of other lands, the grandeurs of the past,
Are not for thee, but grandeurs of thine own,
Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending all,
All eligible to all.

All, all for immortality,
Love like the light silently wrapping all,
Nature's amelioration blessing all,
The blossoms, fruits of ages, orchards divine and certain,
Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual images ripening.

Give me O God to sing that thought,
Give me, give him or her I love this quenchless faith,
In Thy ensemble, whatever else withheld withhold not from us,
Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space,
Health, peace, salvation universal.



                                      



Is it a dream?
Nay but the lack of it the dream,
And failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,
And all the world a dream.



PIONEERS! O PIONEERS!

COME my tanfaced children,
Follow well in order, get your weapons ready,
Have you your pistols? have you your sharpedged axes?
Pioneers! O pioneers!

For we cannot tarry here,
We must march my darlings, we must bear the brunt of danger,
We the youthful sinewy races, all the rest on us depend,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

O you youths, Western youths,
So impatient, full of action, full of manly pride and friendship,
Plain I see you Western youths, see you tramping with the fore
most,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

Have the elder races halted?
Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond 
the seas?
We take up the task eternal, and the burden and the lesson,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

All the past we leave behind,
We debouch upon a newer mightier world, varied world,
Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and the march,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

We detachments steady throwing,
Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains steep,
Conquering, holding, daring, venturing as we go the unknown ways,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

We primeval forests felling,
We the rivers stemming, vexing we and piercing deep the mines 
within,
We the surface broad surveying, we the virgin soil upheaving,
Pioneers! O pioneers!



                                      



Colorado men are we,
From the peaks gigantic, from the great sierras and the high 
plateaus,
From the mine and from the gully, from the hunting trail we come,
Pioneers! O pioneers!
From Nebraska, from Arkansas,
Central inland race are we, from Missouri, with the continental 
blood intervein'd,
All the hands of comrades clasping, all the Southern, all the 
Northern,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

O resistless restless race!
O beloved race in all! O my breast aches with tender love for all!
O I mourn and yet exult, I am rapt with love for all,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

Raise the mighty mother mistress,
Waving high the delicate mistress, over all the starry mistress,
(bend your heads all,)
Raise the fang'd and warlike mistress, stern, impassive, weapon'd 
mistress,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

See my children, resolute children,
By those swarms upon our rear we must never yield or falter,
Ages back in ghostly millions frowning there behind us urging,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

On and on the compact ranks,
With accessions ever waiting, with the places of the dead quickly 
fill'd,
Through the battle, through defeat, moving yet and never stopping,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

O to die advancing on!
Are there some of us to droop and die? has the hour come?
Then upon the march we fittest die, soon and sure the gap is fill'd,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

All the pulses of the world,
Falling in they beat for us, with the Western movement beat,
Holding single or together, steady moving to the front, all for us,
Pioneers! O pioneers!



                                      



Life's involv'd and varied pageants,
All the forms and shows, all the workmen at their work,
All the seamen and the landsmen, all the masters with their slaves,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

All the hapless silent lovers,
All the prisoners in the prisons, all the righteous and the wicked,
All the joyous, all the sorrowing, all the living, all the dying,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

I too with my soul and body,
We, a curious trio, picking, wandering on our way,
Through these shores amid the shadows, with the apparitions 
pressing,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

Lo, the darting bowling orb!
Lo, the brother orbs around, all the clustering suns and planets,
All the dazzling days, all the mystic nights with dreams,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

These are of us, they are with us,
All for primal needed work, while the followers there in embryo 
wait behind,
We today's procession heading, we the route for travel clearing,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

O you daughters of the West!
O you young and elder daughters! O you mothers and you wives!
Never must you be divided, in our ranks you move united,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

Minstrels latent on the prairies!
(Shrouded bards of other lands, you may rest, you have done 
your work,)
Soon I hear you coming warbling, soon you rise and tramp amid us,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

Not for delectations sweet,
Not the cushion and the slipper, not the peaceful and the studious,
Not the riches safe and palling, not for us the tame enjoyment,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

Do the feasters gluttonous feast?
Do the corpulent sleepers sleep? have they lock'd and bolted doors?
Still be ours the diet hard, and the blanket on the ground,
Pioneers! O pioneers!



                                      



Has the night descended?
Was the road of late so toilsome? did we stop discouraged nodding 
on our way?
Yet a passing hour I yield you in your tracks to pause oblivious,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

Till with sound of trumpet,
Far, far off the daybreak call—hark! how loud and clear I hear 
it wind,
Swift! to the head of the army!—swift! spring to your places,
Pioneers! O pioneers!


TO YOU.

WHOEVER you are, I fear you are walking the walks of dreams,
I fear these supposed realities are to melt from under your feet 
and hands,
Even now your features, joys, speech, house, trade, manners,
troubles, follies, costume, crimes, dissipate away from you,
Your true soul and body appear before me,
They stand forth out of affairs, out of commerce, shops, work,
farms, clothes, the house, buying, selling, eating, drinking,
suffering, dying.

Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you be my 
poem,
I whisper with my lips close to your ear,
I have loved many women and men, but I love none better than 
you.

O I have been dilatory and dumb,
I should have made my way straight to you long ago,
I should have blabb'd nothing but you, I should have chanted 
nothing but you.

I will leave all and come and make the hymns of you,
None has understood you, but I understand you,
None has done justice to you, you have not done justice to your
self,
None but has found you imperfect, I only find no imperfection in 
you,
None but would subordinate you, I only am he who will never 
consent to subordinate you,
I only am he who places over you no master, owner, better, God,
beyond what waits intrinsically in yourself.



                                      



Painters have painted their swarming groups and the centrefigure 
of all,
From the head of the centrefigure spreading a nimbus of gold
color'd light,
But I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head without its nim
bus of goldcolor'd light,
From my hand from the brain of every man and woman it streams,
effulgently flowing forever.

O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!
You have not known what you are, you have slumber'd upon 
yourself all your life,
Your eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time,
What you have done returns already in mockeries,
(Your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in mock
eries, what is their return?)

The mockeries are not you,
Underneath them and within them I see you lurk,
I pursue you where none else has pursued you,
Silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the accustom'd 
routine, if these conceal you from others or from yourself,
they do not conceal you from me,
The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if these 
balk others they do not balk me,
The pert apparel, the deform'd attitude, drunkenness, greed, pre
mature death, all these I part aside.

There is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in 
you,
There is no virtue, no beauty in man or woman, but as good is in 
you,
No pluck, no endurance in others, but as good is in you,
No pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits for you.

As for me, I give nothing to any one except I give the like care
fully to you,
I sing the songs of the glory of none, not God, sooner than I 
sing the songs of the glory of you.

Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!
These shows of the East and West are tame compared to you,
These immense meadows, these interminable rivers, you are 
immense and interminable as they,


                                      



These furies, elements, storms, motions of Nature, throes of appar
ent dissolution, you are he or she who is master or mistress 
over them,
Master or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements, pain,
passion, dissolution.

The hopples fall from your ankles, you find an unfailing sufficiency,
Old or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest,
whatever you are promulges itself,
Through birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided, nothing 
is scanted,
Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you are 
picks its way.


FRANCE,
The th Year of these States.

A GREAT year and place,
A harsh discordant natal scream outsounding, to touch the 
mother's heart closer than any yet.

I walk'd the shores of my Eastern sea,
Heard over the waves the little voice,
Saw the divine infant where she woke mournfully wailing, amid the 
roar of cannon, curses, shouts, crash of falling buildings,
Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running, nor from 
the single corpses, nor those in heaps, nor those borne 
away in the tumbrils,
Was not so desperate at the battues of death—was not so shock'd 
at the repeated fusillades of the guns.

Pale, silent, stern, what could I say to that longaccrued retribu
tion?
Could I wish humanity different?
Could I wish the people made of wood and stone?
Or that there be no justice in destiny or time?

O Liberty! O mate for me!
Here too the blaze, the grapeshot and the axe, in reserve, to 
fetch them out in case of need,
Here too, though long represt, can never be destroy'd,
Here too could rise at last murdering and ecstatic,
Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance.

Hence I sign this salute over the sea,
And I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,


                                      



But remember the little voice that I heard wailing, and wait with 
perfect trust, no matter how long,
And from today sad and cogent I maintain the bequeath'd cause,
as for all lands,
And I send these words to Paris with my love,
And I guess some chansonniers there will understand them,
For I guess there is latent music yet in France, floods of it,
O I hear already the bustle of instruments, they will soon be 
drowning all that would interrupt them,
O I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,
It reaches hither, it swells me to joyful madness,
I will run transpose it in words, to justify it,
I will yet sing a song for you ma femme.


MYSELF AND MINE.

MYSELF and mine gymnastic ever,
To stand the cold or heat, to take good aim with a gun, to sail a 
boat, to manage horses, to beget superb children,
To speak readily and clearly, to feel at home among common 
people,
And to hold our own in terrible positions on land and sea.

Not for an embroiderer,
(There will always be plenty of embroiderers, I welcome them also,)
But for the fibre of things and for inherent men and women.

Not to chisel ornaments,
But to chisel with free stroke the heads and limbs of plenteous 
supreme Gods, that the States may realize them walking 
and talking.

Let me have my own way,
Let others promulge the laws, I will make no account of the laws,
Let others praise eminent men and hold up peace, I hold up 
agitation and conflict,
I praise no eminent man, I rebuke to his face the one that was 
thought most worthy.

(Who are you? and what are you secretly guilty of all your life?
Will you turn aside all your life? will you grub and chatter all 
your life?
And who are you, blabbing by rote, years, pages, languages,
reminiscences,


                                      



Unwitting today that you do not know how to speak properly a 
single word?)

Let others finish specimens, I never finish specimens,
I start them by exhaustless laws as Nature does, fresh and modern 
continually.

I give nothing as duties,
What others give as duties I give as living impulses,
(Shall I give the heart's action as a duty?)

Let others dispose of questions, I dispose of nothing, I arouse 
unanswerable questions,
Who are they I see and touch, and what about them?
What about these likes of myself that draw me so close by tender 
directions and indirections?

I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends, but 
listen to my enemies, as I myself do,
I charge you forever reject those who would expound me, for I 
cannot expound myself,
I charge that there be no theory or school founded out of me,
I charge you to leave all free, as I have left all free.

After me, vista!
O I see life is not short, but immeasurably long,
I henceforth tread the world chaste, temperate, an early riser, a 
steady grower,
Every hour the semen of centuries, and still of centuries.

I must follow up these continual lessons of the air, water, earth,
I perceive I have no time to lose.


YEAR OF METEORS.
(–.)

YEAR of meteors! brooding year!
I would bind in words retrospective some of your deeds and signs,
I would sing your contest for the th Presidentiad,
I would sing how an old man, tall, with white hair, mounted the 
scaffold in Virginia,
(I was at hand, silent I stood with teeth shut close, I watch'd,
I stood very near you old man when cool and indifferent, but 
trembling with age and your unheal'd wounds you mounted 
the scaffold;)



                                      



I would sing in my copious song your census returns of the States,
The tables of population and products, I would sing of your ships 
and their cargoes,
The proud black ships of Manhattan arriving, some fill'd with 
immigrants, some from the isthmus with cargoes of gold,
Songs thereof would I sing, to all that hitherward comes would I 
welcome give,
And you would I sing, fair stripling! welcome to you from me,
young prince of England!
(Remember you surging Manhattan's crowds as you pass'd with 
your cortege of nobles?
There in the crowds stood I, and singled you out with attachment;)
Nor forget I to sing of the wonder, the ship as she swam up my 
bay,
Wellshaped and stately the Great Eastern swam up my bay, she 
was  feet long,
Her moving swiftly surrounded by myriads of small craft I forget 
not to sing;
Nor the comet that came unannounced out of the north flaring in 
heaven,
Nor the strange huge meteorprocession dazzling and clear shoot
ing over our heads,
(A moment, a moment long it sail'd its balls of unearthly light 
over our heads,
Then departed, dropt in the night, and was gone;)
Of such, and fitful as they, I sing—with gleams from them would 
I gleam and patch these chants,
Your chants, O year all mottled with evil and good—year of 
forebodings!
Year of comets and meteors transient and strange—lo! even here 
one equally transient and strange!
As I flit through you hastily, soon to fall and be gone, what is this 
chant,
What am I myself but one of your meteors?


WITH ANTECEDENTS.



WITH antecedents,
With my fathers and mothers and the accumulations of past 
ages,
With all which, had it not been, I would not now be here, as I 
am,
With Egypt, India, Phenicia, Greece and Rome,
With the Kelt, the Scandinavian, the Alb and the Saxon,


                                      



With antique maritime ventures, laws, artisanship, wars and jour
neys,
With the poet, the skald, the saga, the myth, and the oracle,
With the sale of slaves, with enthusiasts, with the troubadour, the 
crusader, and the monk,
With those old continents whence we have come to this new 
continent,
With the fading kingdoms and kings over there,
With the fading religions and priests,
With the small shores we look back to from our own large and 
present shores,
With countless years drawing themselves onward and arrived at 
these years,
You and me arrived—America arrived and making this year,
This year! sending itself ahead countless years to come.




O but it is not the years—it is I, it is You,
We touch all laws and tally all antecedents,
We are the skald, the oracle, the monk and the knight, we easily 
include them and more,
We stand amid time beginningless and endless, we stand amid evil 
and good,
All swings around us, there is as much darkness as light,
The very sun swings itself and its system of planets around us,
Its sun, and its again, all swing around us.

As for me, (torn, stormy, amid these vehement days,)
I have the idea of all, and am all and believe in all,
I believe materialism is true and spiritualism is true, I reject no 
part.

(Have I forgotten any part? any thing in the past?
Come to me whoever and whatever, till I give you recogni
tion.)

I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews,
I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demigod,
I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without 
exception,
I assert that all past days were what they must have been,
And that they could nohow have been better than they were,
And that today is what it must be, and that America is,
And that today and America could nohow be better than they 
are.




                                      





In the name of these States and in your and my name, the 
Past,
And in the name of these States and in your and my name, the 
Present time.

I know that the past was great and the future will be great,
And I know that both curiously conjoint in the present time,
(For the sake of him I typify, for the common average man's 
sake, your sake if you are he,)
And that where I am or you are this present day, there is the 
centre of all days, all races,
And there is the meaning to us of all that has ever come of races 
and days, or ever will come.


A BROADWAY PAGEANT.



OVER the Western sea hither from Niphon come,
Courteous, the swartcheek'd twosworded envoys,
Leaning back in their open barouches, bareheaded, impassive,
Ride today through Manhattan.

Libertad! I do not know whether others behold what I behold,
In the procession along with the nobles of Niphon, the errand
bearers,
Bringing up the rear, hovering above, around, or in the ranks 
marching,
But I will sing you a song of what I behold Libertad.

When millionfooted Manhattan unpent descends to her pavements,
When the thundercracking guns arouse me with the proud roar 
I love,
When the roundmouth'd guns out of the smoke and smell I love 
spit their salutes,
When the fireflashing guns have fully alerted me, and heaven
clouds canopy my city with a delicate thin haze,
When gorgeous the countless straight stems, the forests at the 
wharves, thicken with colors,
When every ship richly drest carries her flag at the peak,
When pennants trail and streetfestoons hang from the windows,


                                      



When Broadway is entirely given up to footpassengers and foot
standers, when the mass is densest,
When the façades of the houses are alive with people, when eyes 
gaze riveted tens of thousands at a time,
When the guests from the islands advance, when the pageant 
moves forward visible,
When the summons is made, when the answer that waited thou
sands of years answers,
I too arising, answering, descend to the pavements, merge with 
the crowd, and gaze with them.




Superbfaced Manhattan!
Comrade Americanos! to us, then at last the Orient comes.

To us, my city,
Where our talltopt marble and iron beauties range on opposite 
sides, to walk in the space between,
Today our Antipodes comes.

The Originatress comes,
The nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of eld,
Florid with blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with passion,
Sultry with perfume, with ample and flowing garments,
With sunburnt visage, with intense soul and glittering eyes,
The race of Brahma comes.

See my cantabile! these and more are flashing to us from the 
procession,
As it moves changing, a kaleidoscope divine it moves changing 
before us.

For not the envoys nor the tann'd Japanee from his island only,
Lithe and silent the Hindoo appears, the Asiatic continent itself 
appears, the past, the dead,
The murky nightmorning of wonder and fable inscrutable,
The envelop'd mysteries, the old and unknown hivebees,
The north, the sweltering south, eastern Assyria, the Hebrews, the 
ancient of ancients,
Vast desolated cities, the gliding present, all of these and more are 
in the pageantprocession.

Geography, the world, is in it,
The Great Sea, the brood of islands, Polynesia, the coast beyond,
The coast you henceforth are facing—you Libertad! from your 
Western golden shores,


                                      



The countries there with their populations, the millions enmasse 
are curiously here,
The swarming marketplaces, the temples with idols ranged along 
the sides or at the end, bonze, brahmin, and llama,
Mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisherman,
The singinggirl and the dancinggirl, the ecstatic persons, the 
secluded emperors,
Confucius himself, the great poets and heroes, the warriors, the 
castes, all,
Trooping up, crowding from all directions, from the Altay moun
tains,
From Thibet, from the four winding and farflowing rivers of 
China,
From the southern peninsulas and the demicontinental islands,
from Malaysia,
These and whatever belongs to them palpable show forth to me,
and are seiz'd by me,
And I am seiz'd by them, and friendlily held by them,
Till as here them all I chant, Libertad! for themselves and for 
you.

For I too raising my voice join the ranks of this pageant,
I am the chanter, I chant aloud over the pageant,
I chant the world on my Western sea,
I chant copious the islands beyond, thick as stars in the sky,
I chant the new empire grander than any before, as in a vision it 
comes to me,
I chant America the mistress, I chant a greater supremacy,
I chant projected a thousand blooming cities yet in time on those 
groups of seaislands,
My sailships and steamships threading the archipelagoes,
My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind,
Commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done its work, races 
reborn, refresh'd,
Lives, works resumed—the object I know not—but the old, the 
Asiatic renew'd as it must be,
Commencing from this day surrounded by the world.




And you Libertad of the world!
You shall sit in the middle wellpois'd thousands and thousands of 
years,
As today from one side the nobles of Asia come to you,
As tomorrow from the other side the queen of England sends her 
eldest son to you.



                                      



The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,
The ring is circled, the journey is done,
The boxlid is but perceptibly open'd, nevertheless the perfume 
pours copiously out of the whole box.

Young Libertad! with the venerable Asia, the allmother,
Be considerate with her now and ever hot Libertad, for you are all,
Bend your proud neck to the longoff mother now sending mes
sages over the archipelagoes to you,
Bend your proud neck low for once, young Libertad.

Were the children straying westward so long? so wide the tramping?
Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from Paradise 
so long?
Were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while 
unknown, for you, for reasons?

They are justified, they are accomplish'd, they shall now be turn'd 
the other way also, to travel toward you thence,
They shall now also march obediently eastward for your sake 
Libertad.



SEADRIFT.



—————


OUT OF THE CRADLE ENDLESSLY ROCKING.

OUT of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mockingbird's throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninthmonth midnight,
Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child 
leaving his bed wander'd alone, bareheaded, barefoot,
Down from the shower'd halo,
Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if 
they were alive,
Out from the patches of briers and blackberries,
From the memories of the bird that chanted to me,
From your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and fall
ings I heard,
From under that yellow halfmoon laterisen and swollen as if with 
tears,


                                      



From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist,
From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,
From the myriad thencearous'd words,
From the word stronger and more delicious than any,
From such as now they start the scene revisiting,
As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,
Borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,
A man, yet by these tears a little boy again,
Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,
I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,
Taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,
A reminiscence sing.

Once Paumanok,
When the lilacscent was in the air and Fifthmonth grass was 
growing,
Up this seashore in some briers,
Two feather'd guests from Alabama, two together,
And their nest, and four lightgreen eggs spotted with brown,
And every day the hebird to and fro near at hand,
And every day the shebird crouch'd on her nest, silent, with 
bright eyes,
And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing 
them,
Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.

Shine! shine! shine!
Pour down your warmth, great sun!
While we bask, we two together.

Two together!
Winds blow south, or winds blow north,
Day come white, or night come black,
Home, or rivers and mountains from home,
Singing all time, minding no time,
While we two keep together.

Till of a sudden,
Maybe kill'd, unknown to her mate,
One forenoon the shebird crouch'd not on the nest,
Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,
Nor ever appear'd again.

And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,
And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather,


                                      



Over the hoarse surging of the sea,
Or flitting from brier to brier by day,
I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the hebird,
The solitary guest from Alabama.

Blow! blow! blow!
Blow up seawinds along Paumanok's shore;
I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me.

Yes, when the stars glisten'd,
All night long on the prong of a mossscallop'd stake,
Down almost amid the slapping waves,
Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears.

He call'd on his mate,
He pour'd forth the meanings which I of all men know.

Yes my brother I know,
The rest might not, but I have treasur'd every note,
For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding,
Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows,
Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and 
sights after their sorts,
The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,
I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,
Listen'd long and long.

Listen'd to keep, to sing, now translating the notes,
Following you my brother.

Soothe! soothe! soothe!
Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,
And again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close,
But my love soothes not me, not me.

Low hangs the moon, it rose late,
It is lagging—O I think it is heavy with love, with love.

O madly the sea pushes upon the land,
With love, with love.

O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers?
What is that little black thing I see there in the white?

Loud! loud! loud!
Loud I call to you, my love!



                                      



High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves,
Surely you must know who is here, is here,
You must know who I am, my love.

Lowhanging moon!
What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?
O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!
O moon do not keep her from me any longer.

Land! land! O land!
Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate 
back again if you only would,
For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.

O rising stars!
Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some 
of you.

O throat! O trembling throat!
Sound clearer through the atmosphere!
Pierce the woods, the earth,
Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want.

Shake out carols!
Solitary here, the night's carols!
Carols of lonesome love! death's carols!
Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!
O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea!
O reckless despairing carols.

But soft! sink low!
Soft! let me just murmur,
And do you wait a moment you huskynois'd sea,
For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,
So faint, I must be still, be still to listen,
But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately 
to me.

Hither my love!
Here I am! here!
With this justsustain'd note I announce myself to you,
This gentle call is for you my love, for you.

Do not be decoy'd elsewhere,
That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice,


                                      



That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray,
Those are the shadows of leaves.

O darkness! O in vain!
O I am very sick and sorrowful.

O brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea!
O troubled reflection in the sea!
O throat! O throbbing heart!
And I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night.

O past! O happy life! O songs of joy!
In the air, in the woods, over fields,
Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!
But my mate no more, no more with me!
We two together no more.

The aria sinking,
All else continuing, the stars shining,
The winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing,
With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,
On the sands of Paumanok's shore gray and rustling,
The yellow halfmoon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face 
of the sea almost touching,
The boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the 
atmosphere dallying,
The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultu
ously bursting,
The aria's meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,
The strange tears down the cheeks coursing,
The colloquy there, the trio, each uttering,
The undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying,
To the boy's soul's questions sullenly timing, some drown'd secret 
hissing,
To the outsetting bard.

Demon or bird! (said the boy's soul,)
Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?
For I, that was a child, my tongue's use sleeping, now I have 
heard you,
Now in a moment I know what I am for, I awake,
And already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer, louder 
and more sorrowful than yours,
A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, never 
to die.



                                      



O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me,
O solitary me listening, never more shall I cease perpetuating 
you,
Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,
Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,
Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what 
there in the night,
By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon,
The messenger there arous'd, the fire, the sweet hell within,
The unknown want, the destiny of me.

O give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,)
O if I am to have so much, let me have more!

A word then, (for I will conquer it,)
The word final, superior to all,
Subtle, sent up—what is it?—I listen;
Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea
waves?
Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?

Whereto answering, the sea,
Delaying not, hurrying not,
Whisper'd me through the night, and very plainly before day
break,
Lisp'd to me the low and delicious word death,
And again death, death, death, death,
Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd child's 
heart,
But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,
Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all 
over,
Death, death, death, death, death.

Which I do not forget,
But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,
That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok's gray beach,
With the thousand responsive songs at random,
My own songs awaked from that hour,
And with them the key, the word up from the waves,
The word of the sweetest song and all songs,
That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,
(Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet 
garments, bending aside,)
The sea whisper'd me.



                                      




AS I EBB'D WITH THE OCEAN OF LIFE.



AS I ebb'd with the ocean of life,
As I wended the shores I know,
As I walk'd where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok,
Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant,
Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,
I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,
Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems,
Was seiz'd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,
The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the 
land of the globe.

Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow 
those slender windrows,
Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the seagluten,
Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of saltlettuce, left by the 
tide,
Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,
Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses,
These you presented to me you fishshaped island,
As I wended the shores I know,
As I walk'd with that electric self seeking types.




As I wend to the shores I know not,
As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck'd,
As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,
As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,
I too but signify at the utmost a little wash'dup drift,
A few sands and dead leaves to gather,
Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.

O baffled, balk'd, bent to the very earth,
Oppress'd with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,
Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I 
have not once had the least idea who or what I am,
But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet 
untouch'd, untold, altogether unreach'd,
Withdrawn far, mocking me with mockcongratulatory signs and 
bows,
With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written,
Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath.



                                      



I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single 
object, and that no man ever can,
Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart 
upon me and sting me,
Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.




You oceans both, I close with you,
We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift, knowing 
not why,
These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all.

You friable shore with trails of debris,
You fishshaped island, I take what is underfoot,
What is yours is mine my father.

I too Paumanok,
I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been 
wash'd on your shores,
I too am but a trail of drift and debris,
I too leave little wrecks upon you, you fishshaped island.

I throw myself upon your breast my father,
I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,
I hold you so firm till you answer me something.

Kiss me my father,
Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love,
Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring 
I envy.




Ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,)
Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother,
Endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me,
Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you 
or gather from you.

I mean tenderly by you and all,
I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we 
lead, and following me and mine.

Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses,
Froth, snowy white, and bubbles,
(See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last,



                                      



See, the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,)
Tufts of straw, sands, fragments,
Buoy'd hither from many moods, one contradicting another,
From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell,
Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil,
Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown,
A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating, 
drifted at random,
Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature,
Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloudtrumpets,
We, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out 
before you,
You up there walking or sitting,
Whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet.



TEARS.

TEARS! tears! tears!
In the night, in solitude, tears,
On the white shore dripping, dripping, suck'd in by the sand,
Tears, not a star shining, all dark and desolate,
Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head;
O who is that ghost? that form in the dark, with tears?
What shapeless lump is that, bent, crouch'd there on the sand?
Streaming tears, sobbing tears, throes, choked with wild cries;
O storm, embodied, rising, careering with swift steps along the 
beach!
O wild and dismal night storm, with wind—O belching and des
perate!
O shade so sedate and decorous by day, with calm countenance 
and regulated pace,
But away at night as you fly, none looking—O then the unloosen'd 
ocean,
Of tears! tears! tears!


TO THE MANOFWARBIRD.

THOU who hast slept all night upon the storm,
Waking renew'd on thy prodigious pinions,
(Burst the wild storm? above it thou ascended'st,
And rested on the sky, thy slave that cradled thee,)
Now a blue point, far, far in heaven floating,
As to the light emerging here on deck I watch thee,
(Myself a speck, a point on the world's floating vast.)



                                      



Far, far at sea,
After the night's fierce drifts have strewn the shore with wrecks,
With reappearing day as now so happy and serene,
The rosy and elastic dawn, the flashing sun,
The limpid spread of air cerulean,
Thou also reappearest.

Thou born to match the gale, (thou art all wings,)
To cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurricane,
Thou ship of air that never furl'st thy sails,
Days, even weeks untired and onward, through spaces, realms 
gyrating,
At dusk that look'st on Senegal, at morn America,
That sport'st amid the lightningflash and thundercloud,
In them, in thy experiences, had'st thou my soul,
What joys! what joys were thine!


ABOARD AT A SHIP'S HELM.

ABOARD at a ship's helm,
A young steersman steering with care.

Through fog on a seacoast dolefully ringing,
An oceanbell—O a warning bell, rock'd by the waves.

O you give good notice indeed, you bell by the seareefs ringing,
Ringing, ringing, to warn the ship from its wreckplace.

For as on the alert O steersman, you mind the loud admonition,
The bows turn, the freighted ship tacking speeds away under her 
gray sails,
The beautiful and noble ship with all her precious wealth speeds 
away gayly and safe.

But O the ship, the immortal ship! O ship aboard the ship!
Ship of the body, ship of the soul, voyaging, voyaging, voyaging.


ON THE BEACH AT NIGHT.

ON the beach at night,
Stands a child with her father,
Watching the east, the autumn sky.

Up through the darkness,


                                      



While ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading,
Lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky,
Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east,
Ascends large and calm the lordstar Jupiter,
And nigh at hand, only a very little above,
Swim the delicate sisters the Pleiades.

From the beach the child holding the hand of her father,
Those burialclouds that lower victorious soon to devour all,
Watching, silently weeps.

Weep not, child,
Weep not, my darling,
With these kisses let me remove your tears,
The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious,
They shall not long possess the sky, they devour the stars only in 
apparition,
Jupiter shall emerge, be patient, watch again another night, the 
Pleiades shall emerge,
They are immortal, all those stars both silvery and golden shall 
shine out again,
The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again, they 
endure,
The vast immortal suns and the longenduring pensive moons 
shall again shine.

Then dearest child mournest thou only for Jupiter?
Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars?

Something there is,
(With my lips soothing thee, adding I whisper,
I give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,)
Something there is more immortal even than the stars,
(Many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,)
Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter,
Longer than sun or any revolving satellite,
Or the radiant sisters the Pleiades.


THE WORLD BELOW THE BRINE.

THE world below the brine,
Forests at the bottom of the sea, the branches and leaves,
Sealettuce, vast lichens, strange flowers and seeds, the thick tangle,
openings, and pink turf,


                                      



Different colors, pale gray and green, purple, white, and gold, the 
play of light through the water,
Dumb swimmers there among the rocks, coral, gluten, grass, rushes,
and the aliment of the swimmers,
Sluggish existences grazing there suspended, or slowly crawling 
close to the bottom,
The spermwhale at the surface blowing air and spray, or disporting 
with his flukes,
The leadeneyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy sealeopard,
and the stingray,
Passions there, wars, pursuits, tribes, sight in those oceandepths,
breathing that thickbreathing air, as so many do,
The change thence to the sight here, and to the subtle air breathed 
by beings like us who walk this sphere,
The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other 
spheres.


ON THE BEACH AT NIGHT ALONE.

ON the beach at night alone,
As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song,
As I watch the bright stars shining, I think a thought of the clef 
of the universes and of the future.

A vast similitude interlocks all,
All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,
All distances of place however wide,
All distances of time, all inanimate forms,
All souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different, or in 
different worlds,
All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes, the fishes, the 
brutes,
All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages,
All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe, or any 
globe,
All lives and deaths, all of the past, present, future,
This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann'd,
And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them.


SONG FOR ALL SEAS, ALL SHIPS.



TODAY a rude brief recitative,
Of ships sailing the seas, each with its special flag or shipsignal,


                                      



Of unnamed heroes in the ships—of waves spreading and spread
ing far as the eye can reach,
Of dashing spray, and the winds piping and blowing,
And out of these a chant for the sailors of all nations,
Fitful, like a surge.

Of seacaptains young or old, and the mates, and of all intrepid 
sailors,
Of the few, very choice, taciturn, whom fate can never surprise 
nor death dismay,
Pick'd sparingly without noise by thee old ocean, chosen by thee,
Thou sea that pickest and cullest the race in time, and unitest 
nations,
Suckled by thee, old husky nurse, embodying thee,
Indomitable, untamed as thee.

(Ever the heroes on water or on land, by ones or twos appearing,
Ever the stock preserv'd and never lost, though rare, enough for 
seed preserv'd.)




Flaunt out O sea your separate flags of nations!
Flaunt out visible as ever the various shipsignals!
But do you reserve especially for yourself and for the soul of man 
one flag above all the rest,
A spiritual woven signal for all nations, emblem of man elate above 
death,
Token of all brave captains and all intrepid sailors and mates,
And all that went down doing their duty,
Reminiscent of them, twined from all intrepid captains young or old,
A pennant universal, subtly waving all time, o'er all brave sailors,
All seas, all ships.



PATROLING BARNEGAT.

WILD, wild the storm, and the sea high running,
Steady the roar of the gale, with incessant undertone muttering,
Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing,
Waves, air, midnight, their savagest trinity lashing,
Out in the shadows there milkwhite combs careering,
On beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting,
Where through the murk the easterly deathwind breasting,
Through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing,
(That in the distance! is that a wreck? is the red signal flaring?)


                                      



Slush and sand of the beach tireless till daylight wending,
Steadily, slowly, through hoarse roar never remitting,
Along the midnight edge by those milkwhite combs careering,
A group of dim, weird forms, struggling, the night confronting,
That savage trinity warily watching.


AFTER THE SEASHIP.

AFTER the seaship, after the whistling winds,
After the whitegray sails taut to their spars and ropes,
Below, a myriad myriad waves hastening, lifting up their necks,
Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship,
Waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling, blithely prying,
Waves, undulating waves, liquid, uneven, emulous waves,
Toward that whirling current, laughing and buoyant, with curves,
Where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface,
Larger and smaller waves in the spread of the ocean yearnfully 
flowing,
The wake of the seaship after she passes, flashing and frolicsome 
under the sun,
A motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments,
Following the stately and rapid ship, in the wake following.

BY THE ROADSIDE.



—————


A BOSTON BALLAD.
(.)

TO get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early,
Here's a good place at the corner, I must stand and see the show.

Clear the way there Jonathan!
Way for the President's marshal—way for the government cannon!
Way for the Federal foot and dragoons, (and the apparitions 
copiously tumbling.)

I love to look on the Stars and Stripes, I hope the fifes will play 
Yankee Doodle.


                                      



How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!
Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.

A fog follows, antiques of the same come limping,
Some appear woodenlegged, and some appear bandaged and 
bloodless.

Why this is indeed a show—it has called the dead out of the 
earth!
The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see!
Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!
Cock'd hats of mothy mould—crutches made of mist!
Arms in slings—old men leaning on young men's shoulders.

What troubles you Yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering 
of bare gums?
Does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches 
for firelocks and level them?

If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President's 
marshal,
If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon.

For shame old maniacs—bring down those toss'd arms, and let 
your white hair be,
Here gape your great grandsons, their wives gaze at them from 
the windows,
See how well dress'd, see how orderly they conduct themselves.

Worse and worse—can't you stand it? are you retreating?
Is this hour with the living too dead for you?

Retreat then—pellmell!
To your graves—back—back to the hills old limpers!
I do not think you belong here anyhow.

But there is one thing that belongs here—shall I tell you what it 
is, gentlemen of Boston?

I will whisper it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to 
England,
They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the 
royal vault,
Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave
clothes, box up his bones for a journey,


                                      



Find a swift Yankee clipper—here is freight for you, blackbellied 
clipper,
Up with your anchor—shake out your sails—steer straight toward 
Boston bay.

Now call for the President's marshal again, bring out the govern
ment cannon,
Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession,
guard it with foot and dragoons.

This centrepiece for them;
Look, all orderly citizens—look from the windows, women!

The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that 
will not stay,
Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the 
skull.

You have got your revenge, old buster—the crown is come to its 
own, and more than its own.

Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan—you are a made 
man from this day,
You are mighty cute—and here is one of your bargains.


EUROPE,
The d and d Years of These States.

SUDDENLY out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,
Like lightning it le'pt forth half startled at itself,
Its feet upon the ashes and the rags, its hands tight to the throats 
of kings.

O hope and faith!
O aching close of exiled patriots' lives!
O many a sicken'd heart!
Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh.

And you, paid to defile the People—you liars, mark!
Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,
For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his 
simplicity the poor man's wages,
For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh'd 
at in the breaking,



                                      



Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge,
or the heads of the nobles fall;
The People scorn'd the ferocity of kings.

But the sweetness of mercy brew'd bitter destruction, and the 
frighten'd monarchs come back,
Each comes in state with his train, hangman, priest, taxgatherer,
Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.

Yet behind all lowering stealing, lo, a shape,
Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in 
scarlet folds,
Whose face and eyes none may see,
Out of its robes only this, the red robes lifted by the arm,
One finger crook'd pointed high over the top, like the head of a 
snake appears.

Meanwhile corpses lie in newmade graves, bloody corpses of 
young men,
The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are 
flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud,
And all these things bear fruits, and they are good.

Those corpses of young men,
Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets, those hearts pierc'd by 
the gray lead,
Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaugh
ter'd vitality.

They live in other young men O kings!
They live in brothers again ready to defy you,
They were purified by death, they were taught and exalted.

Not a grave of the murder'd for freedom but grows seed for free
dom, in its turn to bear seed,
Which the winds carry afar and resow, and the rains and the 
snows nourish.

Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,
But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling,
cautioning.

Liberty, let others despair of you—I never despair of you.

Is the house shut? is the master away?
Nevertheless, be ready, be not weary of watching,
He will soon return, his messengers come anon.



                                      




A HANDMIRROR.

HOLD it up sternly—see this it sends back, (who is it? is it 
you?)
Outside fair costume, within ashes and filth,
No more a flashing eye, no more a sonorous voice or springy 
step,
Now some slave's eye, voice, hands, step,
A drunkard's breath, unwholesome eater's face, venerealee's flesh,
Lungs rotting away piecemeal, stomach sour and cankerous,
Joints rheumatic, bowels clogged with abomination,
Blood circulating dark and poisonous streams,
Words babble, hearing and touch callous,
No brain, no heart left, no magnetism of sex;
Such from one look in this lookingglass ere you go hence,
Such a result so soon—and from such a beginning!


GODS.

LOVER divine and perfect Comrade,
Waiting content, invisible yet, but certain,
Be thou my God.

Thou, thou, the Ideal Man,
Fair, able, beautiful, content, and loving,
Complete in body and dilate in spirit,
Be thou my God.

O Death, (for Life has served its turn,)
Opener and usher to the heavenly mansion,
Be thou my God.

Aught, aught of mightiest, best I see, conceive, or know,
(To break the stagnant tie—thee, thee to free, O soul,)
Be thou my God.

All great ideas, the races' aspirations,
All heroisms, deeds of rapt enthusiasts,
Be ye my Gods.

Or Time and Space,
Or shape of Earth divine and wondrous,
Or some fair shape I viewing, worship,
Or lustrous orb of sun or star by night,
Be ye my Gods.



                                      




GERMS.

FORMS, qualities, lives, humanity, language, thoughts,
The ones known, and the ones unknown, the ones on the stars,
The stars themselves, some shaped, others unshaped,
Wonders as of those countries, the soil, trees, cities, inhabitants,
whatever they may be,
Splendid suns, the moons and rings, the countless combinations 
and effects,
Suchlike, and as good as suchlike, visible here or anywhere,
stand provided for in a handful of space, which I extend 
my arm and half enclose with my hand,
That containing the start of each and all, the virtue, the germs 
of all.


THOUGHTS.

OF ownership—as if one fit to own things could not at pleasure 
enter upon all, and incorporate them into himself or herself;
Of vista—suppose some sight in arriere through the formative 
chaos, presuming the growth, fulness, life, now attain'd on 
the journey,
(But I see the road continued, and the journey ever continued;)
Of what was once lacking on earth, and in due time has become 
supplied—and of what will yet be supplied,
Because all I see and know I believe to have its main purport in 
what will yet be supplied.


WHEN I HEARD THE LEARN'D ASTRONOMER.

WHEN I heard the learn'd astronomer,
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and 
measure them,
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much 
applause in the lectureroom,
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,
Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,
In the mystical moist nightair, and from time to time,
Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.


PERFECTIONS.

ONLY themselves understand themselves and the like of themselves,
As souls only understand souls.




                                      




O ME! O LIFE!

O ME! O life! of the questions of these recurring,
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill'd with the 
foolish,
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than 
I, and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the 
struggle ever renew'd,
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I 
see around me,
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me inter
twined,
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these,
O me, O life?
Answer.

That you are here—that life exists and identity,
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.



TO A PRESIDENT.

ALL you are doing and saying is to America dangled mirages,
You have not learn'd of Nature—of the politics of Nature you 
have not learn'd the great amplitude, rectitude, impartiality,
You have not seen that only such as they are for these States,
And that what is less than they must sooner or later lift off from 
these States.


I SIT AND LOOK OUT.

I SIT and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon all 
oppression and shame,
I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men at anguish with 
themselves, remorseful after deeds done,
I see in low life the mother misused by her children, dying,
neglected, gaunt, desperate,
I see the wife misused by her husband, I see the treacherous 
seducer of young women,
I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love attempted to 
be hid, I see these sights on the earth,
I see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny, I see martyrs and 
prisoners,
I observe a famine at sea, I observe the sailors casting lots who 
shall be kill'd to preserve the lives of the rest,


                                      



I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons 
upon laborers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like;
All these—all the meanness and agony without end I sitting look 
out upon,
See, hear, and am silent.


TO RICH GIVERS.

WHAT you give me I cheerfully accept,
A little sustenance, a hut and garden, a little money, as I rendez
vous with my poems,
A traveler's lodging and breakfast as I journey through the States,
—why should I be ashamed to own such gifts? why to 
advertise for them?
For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman,
For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts 
of the universe.


THE DALLIANCE OF THE EAGLES.

SKIRTING the river road, (my forenoon walk, my rest,)
Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound, the dalliance of the eagles,
The rushing amorous contact high in space together,
The clinching interlocking claws, a living, fierce, gyrating wheel,
Four beating wings, two beaks, a swirling mass tight grappling,
In tumbling turning clustering loops, straight downward falling,
Till o'er the river pois'd, the twain yet one, a moment's lull,
A motionless still balance in the air, then parting, talons loosing,
Upward again on slowfirm pinions slanting, their separate diverse 
flight,
She hers, he his, pursuing.


ROAMING IN THOUGHT.
(After reading HEGEL.)

Roaming in thought over the Universe, I saw the little that is 
Good steadily hastening towards immortality,
And the vast all that is call'd Evil I saw hastening to merge itself 
and become lost and dead.


A FARM PICTURE.

THROUGH the ample open door of the peaceful country barn,
A sunlit pasture field with cattle and horses feeding,
And haze and vista, and the far horizon fading away.



                                      




A CHILD'S AMAZE

SILENT and amazed even when a little boy,
I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his 
statements,
As contending against some being or influence.


THE RUNNER.

ON a flat road runs the welltrain'd runner,
He is lean and sinewy with muscular legs,
He is thinly clothed, he leans forward as he runs,
With lightly closed fists and arms partially rais'd.


BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

WOMEN sit or move to and fro, some old, some young,
The young are beautiful—but the old are more beautiful than the 
young.


MOTHER AND BABE.

I SEE the sleeping babe nestling the breast of its mother,
The sleeping mother and babe—hush'd, I study them long and 
long.


THOUGHT.

OF obedience, faith, adhesiveness;
As I stand aloof and look there is to me something profoundly 
affecting in large masses of men following the lead of those 
who do not believe in men.


VISOR'D.

A MASK, a perpetual natural disguiser of herself,
Concealing her face, concealing her form,
Changes and transformations every hour, every moment,
Falling upon her even when she sleeps.


THOUGHT.

OF Justice—as if Justice could be any thing but the same ample 
law, expounded by natural judges and saviors,
As if it might be this thing or that thing, according to decisions.



                                      




GLIDING O'ER ALL.

GLIDING o'er all, through all,
Through Nature, Time, and Space,
As a ship on the waters advancing,
The voyage of the soul—not life alone,
Death, many deaths I'll sing.


HAST NEVER COME TO THEE AN HOUR.

HAST never come to thee an hour,
A sudden gleam divine, precipitating, bursting all these bubbles,
fashions, wealth?
These eager business aims—books, politics, art, amours,
To utter nothingness?


THOUGHT.

OF Equality—as if it harm'd me, giving others the same chances 
and rights as myself—as if it were not indispensable to 
my own rights that others possess the same.


TO OLD AGE.

I SEE in you the estuary that enlarges and spreads itself grandly as 
it pours in the great sea.


LOCATIONS AND TIMES.

LOCATIONS and times—what is it in me that meets them all, when
ever and wherever, and makes me at home?
Forms, colors, densities, odors—what is it in me that corresponds 
with them?


OFFERINGS.

A THOUSAND perfect men and women appear,
Around each gathers a cluster of friends, and gay children and 
youths, with offerings.


TO THE STATES,
To Identify the th, th, or th Presidentiad.

WHY reclining, interrogating? why myself and all drowsing?
What deepening twilight—scum floating atop of the waters,


                                      



Who are they as bats and nightdogs askant in the capitol?
What a filthy Presidentiad! (O South, your torrid suns! O North,
your arctic freezings!)
Are those really Congressmen? are those the great Judges? is that 
the President?
Then I will sleep awhile yet, for I see that these States sleep, for 
reasons;
(With gathering murk, with muttering thunder and lambent shoots 
we all duly awake,
South, North, East, West, inland and seaboard, we will surely 
awake.)

DRUMTAPS.



—————


FIRST O SONGS FOR A PRELUDE.

FIRST O songs for a prelude,
Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in my city,
How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,
How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,
(O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!
O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than steel!)
How you sprang—how you threw off the costumes of peace with 
indifferent hand,
How your soft operamusic changed, and the drum and fife were 
heard in their stead,
How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs 
of soldiers,)
How Manhattan drumtaps led.

Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,
Forty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this teeming 
and turbulent city,
Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,
With her million children around her, suddenly,
At dead of night, at news from the south,
Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.

A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,
Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its myriads.



                                      



From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the 
doorways,
Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.

To the drumtaps prompt,
The young men falling in and arming,
The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jackplane, the black
smith's hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)
The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the 
court,
The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down,
throwing the reins abruptly down on the horses' backs,
The salesman leaving the store, the boss, bookkeeper, porter, all 
leaving;
Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,
The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear 
their accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,
Outdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musketbarrels,
The white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around, the 
sunrise cannon and again at sunset,
Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and 
embark from the wharves,
(How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty,
with their guns on their shoulders!
How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces 
and their clothes and knapsacks cover'd with dust!)
The blood of the city up—arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,
The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the 
public buildings and stores,
The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his 
mother,
(Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to 
detain him,)
The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing 
the way,
The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their 
favorites,
The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along,
rumble lightly over the stones,
(Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,
Soon unlimber'd to begin the red business;)
All the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,
The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,
The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest,
no mere parade now;


                                      



War! an arm'd race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no 
turning away;
War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing 
to welcome it.

Mannahatta amarch—and it's O to sing it well!
It's O for a manly life in the camp.

And the sturdy artillery,
The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,
Unlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salutes for 
courtesies merely,
Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)

And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,
Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,
Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd 
amid all your children,
But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.


EIGHTEEN SIXTYONE.

ARM'D year—year of the struggle,
No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year,
Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas 
piano,
But as a strong man erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing,
carrying a rifle on your shoulder,
With wellgristled body and sunburnt face and hands, with a knife 
in the belt at your side,
As I heard you shouting loud, your sonorous voice ringing across 
the continent,
Your masculine voice O year, as rising amid the great cities,
Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen,
the dwellers in Manhattan,
Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and 
Indiana,
Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the 
Alleghanies,
Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania, or on deck 
along the Ohio river,
Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at 
Chattanooga on the mountain top,
Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue,
bearing weapons, robust year,


                                      



Heard your determin'd voice launch'd forth again and again,
Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the roundlipp'd cannon,
I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.


BEAT! BEAT! DRUMS!

BEAT! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!
Through the windows—through doors—burst like a ruthless 
force,
Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,
Into the school where the scholar is studying;
Leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happiness must he have 
now with his bride,
Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering 
his grain,
So fierce you whirr and pound you drums—so shrill you bugles 
blow.

Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!
Over the traffic of cities—over the rumble of wheels in the 
streets;
Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers 
must sleep in those beds,
No bargainers' bargains by day—no brokers or speculators—
would they continue?
Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?
Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the 
judge?
Then rattle quicker, heavier drums—you bugles wilder blow.

Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!
Make no parley—stop for no expostulation,
Mind not the timid—mind not the weeper or prayer,
Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,
Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties,
Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting 
the hearses,
So strong you thump O terrible drums—so loud you bugles blow.


FROM PAUMANOK STARTING I FLY LIKE A BIRD.

FROM Paumanok starting I fly like a bird,
Around and around to soar to sing the idea of all,
To the north betaking myself to sing there arctic songs,


                                      



To Kanada till I absorb Kanada in myself, to Michigan then,
To Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, to sing their songs, (they are 
inimitable;)
Then to Ohio and Indiana to sing theirs, to Missouri and Kansas 
and Arkansas to sing theirs,
To Tennessee and Kentucky, to the Carolinas and Georgia to sing 
theirs,
To Texas and so along up toward California, to roam accepted 
everywhere;
To sing first, (to the tap of the wardrum if need be,)
The idea of all, of the Western world one and inseparable,
And then the song of each member of these States.


SONG OF THE BANNER AT DAYBREAK.

Poet.

O A new song, a free song,
Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,
By the wind's voice and that of the drum,
By the banner's voice and child's voice and sea's voice and father's 
voice,
Low on the ground and high in the air,
On the ground where father and child stand,
In the upward air where their eyes turn,
Where the banner at daybreak is flapping.

Words! bookwords! what are you?
Words no more, for hearken and see,
My song is there in the open air, and I must sing,
With the banner and pennant aflapping.

I'll weave the chord and twine in,
Man's desire and babe's desire, I'll twine them in, I'll put in life,
I'll put the bayonet's flashing point, I'll let bullets and slugs whizz,
(As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the future,
Crying with trumpet voice, Arouse and beware! Beware and 
arouse!)
I'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of joy,
Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,
With the banner and pennant aflapping.


Pennant.

Come up here, bard, bard,
Come up here, soul, soul,


                                      



Come up here, dear little child,
To fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the measure
less light.


Child.

Father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?
And what does it say to me all the while?


Father.

Nothing my babe you see in the sky,
And nothing at all to you it says—but look you my babe,
Look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the 
moneyshops opening,
And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with 
goods;
These, ah these, how valued and toil'd for these!
How envied by all the earth.


Poet.

Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high,
On floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels,
On floats the wind over the breast of thesea setting in toward 
land,
The great steady wind from west or westbysouth,
Floating so buoyant with milkwhite foam on the waters.

But I am not the sea nor the red sun,
I am not the wind with girlish laughter,
Not the immense wind which strengthens, not the wind which 
lashes,
Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death,
But I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,
Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,
Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings,
And the shoresands know and the hissing wave, and that banner 
and pennant,
Aloft there flapping and flapping.


Child.

O father it is alive—it is full of people—it has children,
O now it seems to me it is talking to its children,
I hear it—it talks to me—O it is wonderful!
O it stretches—it spreads and runs so fast—O my father,
It is so broad it covers the whole sky.




                                      



Father.

Cease, cease, my foolish babe,
What you are saying is sorrowful to me, much it displeases me;
Behold with the rest again I say, behold not banners and pennants 
aloft,
But the wellprepared pavements behold, and mark the solidwall'd 
houses.


Banner and Pennant.

Speak to the child O bard out of Manhattan,
To our children all, or north or south of Manhattan,
Point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all—and yet we 
know not why,
For what are we, mere strips of cloth profiting nothing,
Only flapping in the wind?


Poet.

I hear and see not strips of cloth alone,
I hear the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry,
I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men, I hear Liberty!
I hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing,
I myself move abroad swiftrising flying then,
I use the wings of the landbird and use the wings of the seabird, 
and look down as from a height,
I do not deny the precious results of peace, I see populous cities 
with wealth incalculable,
I see numberless farms, I see the farmers working in their fields 
or barns,
I see mechanics working, I see buildings everywhere founded, 
going up, or finish'd,
I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks drawn 
by the locomotives,
I see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston, New 
Orleans,
I see far in the West the immense area of grain, I dwell awhile 
hovering,
I pass to the lumber forests of the North, and again to the South
ern plantation, and again to California;
Sweeping the whole I see the countless profit, the busy gatherings, 
earn'd wages,
See the Identity formed out of thirtyeight spacious and haughty 
States, (and many more to come,)
See forts on the shores of harbors, see ships sailing in and out;
Then over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen'd pennant 
shaped like a sword,


                                      



Runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance—and now the hal
yards have rais'd it,
Side of my banner broad and blue, side of my starry banner,
Discarding peace over all the sea and land.


Banner and Pennant.

Yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!
No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone,
We may be terror and carnage, and are so now,
Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States, 
(nor any five, nor ten,)
Nor market nor depot we, nor moneybank in the city,
But these and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the 
mines below, are ours,
And the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and small,
And the fields they moisten, and the crops and the fruits are ours,
Bays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ours—while 
we over all,
Over the area spread below, the three or four millions of square 
miles, the capitals,
The forty millions of people,—O bard! in life and death supreme,
We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,
Not for the present alone, for a thousand years chanting through 
you,
This song to the soul of one poor little child.


Child.

O my father I like not the houses,
They will never to me be any thing, nor do I like money,
But to mount up there I would like, O father dear, that banner I 
like,
That pennant I would be and must be.


Father.

Child of mine you fill me with anguish,
To be that pennant would be too fearful,
Little you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever,
It is to gain nothing, but risk and defy every thing,
Forward to stand in front of wars—and O, such wars!—what 
have you to do with them?
With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?


Banner.

Demons and death then I sing,
Put in all, aye all will I, swordshaped pennant for war,


                                      



And a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of 
children,
Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid wash 
of the sea,
And the black ships fighting on the sea envelop'd in smoke,
And the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and 
pines,
And the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching, and 
the hot sun shining south,
And the beachwaves combing over the beach on my Eastern 
shore, and my Western shore the same,
And all between those shores, and my ever running Mississippi 
with bends and chutes,
And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of 
Missouri,
The Continent, devoting the whole identity without reserving an 
atom,
Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all and the 
yield of all,
Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole,
No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,
But out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no 
more,
Croaking like crows here in the wind.


Poet.

My limbs, my veins dilate, my theme is clear at last,
Banner so broad advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty 
and resolute,
I burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen'd and 
blinded,
My hearing and tongue are come to me, (a little child taught me,)
I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand,
Insensate! insensate! (yet I at any rate chant you,) O banner!
Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their pros
perity, (if need be, you shall again have every one of those 
houses to destroy them,
You thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast, 
full of comfort, built with money,
May they stand fast, then? not an hour except you above them 
and all stand fast;)
O banner, not money so precious are you, not farm produce you, 
nor the material good nutriment,
Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships,


                                      



Not the superb ships with sailpower or steampower, fetching and 
carrying cargoes,
Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues—but you as hence
forth I see you,
Running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars, (ever
enlarging stars,)
Divider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touch'd by the sun, 
measuring the sky,
(Passionately seen and yearn'd for by one poor little child,
While others remain busy or smartly talking, forever teaching 
thrift, thrift;)
O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake 
hissing so curious,
Out of reach, an idea only, yet furiously fought for, risking bloody 
death, loved by me,
So loved—O you banner leading the day with stars brought from 
the night!
Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all—(absolute 
owner of all)—O banner and pennant!
I too leave the rest—great as it is, it is nothing—houses, 
machines are nothing—I see them not,
I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes, 
I sing you only,
Flapping up there in the wind.



RISE O DAYS FROM YOUR FATHOMLESS DEEPS.



RISE O days from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier, fiercer 
sweep,
Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devour'd what the earth 
gave me,
Long I roam'd the woods of the north, long I watch'd Niagara 
pouring,
I travel'd the prairies over and slept on their breast, I cross'd the 
Nevadas, I cross'd the plateaus,
I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail'd out to 
sea,
I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm,
I watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves,
I mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high, curling 
over,
I heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds,


                                      



Saw from below what arose and mounted, (O superb! O wild as 
my heart, and powerful!)
Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow'd after the lightning,
Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and 
fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky;
These, and such as these, I, elate, saw—saw with wonder, yet 
pensive and masterful,
All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,
Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.




'Twas well, O soul—'twas a good preparation you gave me,
Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill,
Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never 
gave us,
Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier 
cities,
Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring,
Torrents of men, (sources and rills of the Northwest are you 
indeed inexhaustible?)
What, to pavements and homesteads here, what were those storms 
of the mountains and sea?
What, to passions I witness around me today? was the sea risen?
Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?
Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and 
savage,
Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front—Cincinnati, 
Chicago, unchain'd;
What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here,
How it climbs with daring feet and hands—how it dashes!
How the true thunder bellows after the lightning—how bright 
the flashes of lightning!
How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown 
through the dark by those flashes of lightning!
(Yet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through the 
dark,
In a lull of the deafening confusion.)




Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!
And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities!
Crash heavier, heavier yet O storms! you have done me good,
My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong 
nutriment,


                                      



Long had I walk'd my cities, my country roads through farms, 
only half satisfied,
One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the 
ground before me,
Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically 
hissing low;
The cities I loved so well I abandon'd and left, I sped to the 
certainties suitable to me,
Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies and Nature's 
dauntlessness,
I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only,
I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire—on the water and air 
I waited long;
But now I no longer wait, I am fully satisfied, I am glutted,
I have witness'd the true lightning, I have witness'd my cities 
electric,
I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise,
Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,
No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea.



VIRGINIA—THE WEST.

THE noble sire fallen on evil days,
I saw with hand uplifted, menacing, brandishing,
(Memories of old in abeyance, love and faith in abeyance,)
The insane knife toward the Mother of All.

The noble son on sinewy feet advancing,
I saw, out of the land of prairies, land of Ohio's waters and of 
Indiana,
To the rescue the stalwart giant hurry his plenteous offspring,
Drest in blue, bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders.

Then the Mother of All with calm voice speaking,
As to you Rebellious, (I seemed to hear her say,) why strive 
against me, and why seek my life?
When you yourself forever provide to defend me?
For you provided me Washington—and now these also.


CITY OF SHIPS.

CITY of ships!
(O the black ships! O the fierce ships!
O the beautiful sharpbow'd steamships and sailships!)


                                      



City of the world! (for all races are here,
All the lands of the earth make contributions here;)
City of the sea! city of hurried and glittering tides!
City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling in 
and out with eddies and foam!
City of wharves and stores—city of tall façades of marble and 
iron!
Proud and passionate city—mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!
Spring up O city—not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself,
warlike!
Fear not—submit to no models but your own O city!
Behold me—incarnate me as I have incarnated you!
I have rejected nothing you offer'd me—whom you adopted I 
have adopted,
Good or bad I never question you—I love all—I do not con
demn any thing,
I chant and celebrate all that is yours—yet peace no more,
In peace I chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine,
War, red war is my song through your streets, O city!


THE CENTENARIAN'S STORY.
Volunteer of , (at Washington Park, Brooklyn, assisting the Centenarian.)

GIVE me your hand old Revolutionary,
The hilltop is nigh, but a few steps, (make room gentlemen,)
Up the path you have follow'd me well, spite of your hundred and 
extra years,
You can walk old man, though your eyes are almost done,
Your faculties serve you, and presently I must have them serve me.

Rest, while I tell what the crowd around us means,
On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising,
There is the camp, one regiment departs tomorrow,
Do you hear the officers giving their orders?
Do you hear the clank of the muskets?

Why what comes over you now old man?
Why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively?
The troops are but drilling, they are yet surrounded with smiles,
Around them at hand the welldrest friends and the women,
While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,
Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying 
breeze,
O'er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.



                                      



But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,
Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!

As wending the crowds now part and disperse—but we old man,
Not for nothing have I brought you hither—we must remain,
You to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.


The Centenarian.

When I clutch'd your hand it was not with terror,
But suddenly pouring about me here on every side,
And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes 
they ran,
And where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see south and 
southeast and southwest,
Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,
And along the shores, in mire (now fill'd over) came again and 
suddenly raged,
As eightyfive years agone no mere parade receiv'd with applause 
of friends,
But a battle which I took part in myself—aye, long ago as it is, 
I took part in it,
Walking then this hilltop, this same ground.

Aye, this is the ground,
My blind eyes even as I speak behold it repeopled from graves,
The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,
Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,
I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay,
I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;
Here we lay encamp'd, it was this time in summer also.

As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,
It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,
By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held 
up his unsheath'd sword,
It glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.

'Twas a bold act then—the English warships had just arrived,
We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,
And the transports swarming with soldiers.

A few days more and they landed, and then the battle.

Twenty thousand were brought against us,
A veteran force furnish'd with good artillery.



                                      



I tell not now the whole of the battle,
But one brigade early in the forenoon order'd forward to engage 
the redcoats,
Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,
And how long and well it stood confronting death.

Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting 
death?
It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,
Rais'd in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known per
sonally to the General.

Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus' waters,
Till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods, gain'd 
at night,
The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing 
their guns,
That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's mercy.

The General watch'd them from this hill,
They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,
Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the 
middle,
But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning 
them!

It sickens me yet, that slaughter!
I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.
I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.

Meanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a pitch'd 
battle,
But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.

We fought the fight in detachments,
Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was 
against us,
Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back 
to the works on this hill,
Till we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us.

That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two 
thousand strong,
Few return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.



                                      



That and here my General's first battle,
No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude 
with applause,
Nobody clapp'd hands here then.

But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,
Wearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,
While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord off against us 
encamp'd,
Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over 
their victory.

So dull and damp and another day,
But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,
Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my 
General retreated.

I saw him at the riverside,
Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;
My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd 
over,
And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for 
the last time.

Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,
Many no doubt thought of capitulation.

But when my General pass'd me,
As he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,
I saw something different from capitulation.


Terminus.

Enough, the Centenarian's story ends,
The two, the past and present, have interchanged,
I myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now 
speaking.

And is this the ground Washington trod?
And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he 
cross'd,
As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?

I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,
I must preserve that look as it beam'd on you rivers of Brooklyn.

See—as the annual round returns the phantoms return,
It is the th of August and the British have landed,


                                      



The battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke 
Washington's face,
The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to inter
cept the enemy,
They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon 
them,
Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,
Baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds,
In death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.

Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable 
than your owners supposed;
In the midst of you stands an encampment very old,
Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade.



CAVALRY CROSSING A FORD.

A LINE in long array where they wind betwixt green islands,
They take a serpentine course, their arms flash in the sun—hark 
to the musical clank,
Behold the silvery river, in it the splashing horses loitering stop to 
drink,
Behold the brownfaced men, each group, each person a picture,
the negligent rest on the saddles,
Some emerge on the opposite bank, others are just entering the 
ford—while,
Scarlet and blue and snowy white,
The guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind.


BIVOUAC ON A MOUNTAIN SIDE.

I SEE before me now a traveling army halting,
Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of 
summer,
Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising 
high,
Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily 
seen,
The numerous campfires scatter'd near and far, some away up on 
the mountain,
The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, largesized,
flickering,
And over all the sky—the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,
breaking out, the eternal stars.



                                      




AN ARMY CORPS ON THE MARCH.

WITH its cloud of skirmishers in advance,
With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and 
now an irregular volley,
The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press 
on,
Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun—the dustcover'd men,
In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,
With artillery interspers'd—the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,
As the army corps advances.


BY THE BIVOUAC'S FITFUL FLAME.

BY the bivouac's fitful flame,
A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow—but 
first I note,
The tents of the sleeping army, the fields' and woods' dim 
outline,
The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire, the silence,
Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving,
The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily 
watching me,)
While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous 
thoughts,
Of life and death, of home and the past and loved, and of those 
that are far away;
A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,
By the bivouac's fitful flame.


COME UP FROM THE FIELDS FATHER.

COME up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete,
And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy dear 
son.

Lo, 'tis autumn,
Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,
Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the 
moderate wind,
Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd 
vines,
(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?
Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)



                                      



Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and 
with wondrous clouds,
Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers 
well.

Down in the fields all prospers well,
But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's call,
And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.

Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps 
trembling,
She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.

Open the envelope quickly,
O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,
O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's soul!
All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main 
words only,
Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, 
taken to hospital,
At present low, but will soon be better.

Ah now the single figure to me,
Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,
Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,
By the jamb of a door leans.

Grieve not so, dear mother, (the justgrown daughter speaks 
through her sobs,
The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd,)
See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better.

Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor maybe needs to be 
better, that brave and simple soul,)
While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,
The only son is dead.

But the mother needs to be better,
She with thin form presently drest in black,
By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping, often 
waking,
In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,
O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and 
withdraw,
To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.



                                      




VIGIL STRANGE I KEPT ON THE FIELD ONE NIGHT.

VIGIL strange I kept on the field one night;
When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,
One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look I 
shall never forget,
One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you lay on 
the ground,
Then onward I sped in the battle, the evencontested battle,
Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my 
way,
Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son 
of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)
Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the 
moderate nightwind,
Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle
field spreading,
Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,
But not a tear fell, not even a longdrawn sigh, long, long I gazed,
Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my 
chin in my hands,
Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest 
comrade—not a tear, not a word,
Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my 
soldier,
As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,
Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your 
death,
I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall 
surely meet again,)
Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn 
appear'd,
My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,
Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and care
fully under feet,
And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his 
grave, in his rudedug grave I deposited,
Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battlefield 
dim,
Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth 
responding,)
Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day 
brighten'd,
I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his 
blanket,
And buried him where he fell.



                                      




A MARCH IN THE RANKS HARDPREST, AND THE 
ROAD UNKNOWN.

A MARCH in the ranks hardprest, and the road unknown,
A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,
Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,
Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dimlighted 
building,
We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim
lighted building,
'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu 
hospital,
Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and 
poems ever made,
Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and 
lamps,
And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and 
clouds of smoke,
By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some 
in the pews laid down,
At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of 
bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)
I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as 
a lily,)
Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to 
absorb it all,
Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,
some of them dead,
Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,
the odor of blood,
The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside 
also fill'd,
Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in 
the deathspasm sweating,
An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,
The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the 
torches,
These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,
Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;
But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a halfsmile gives 
he me,
Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the 
darkness,
Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,
The unknown road still marching.



                                      




A SIGHT IN CAMP IN THE DAYBREAK GRAY AND 
DIM.

A SIGHT in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,
As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,
As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital 
tent,
Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended 
lying,
Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woolen blanket,
Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.

Curious I halt and silent stand,
Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first just 
lift the blanket;
Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with wellgray'd 
hair, and flesh all sunken about the eyes?
Who are you my dear comrade?

Then to the second I step—and who are you my child and 
darling?
Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?

Then to the third—a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of 
beautiful yellowwhite ivory;
Young man I think I know you—I think this face is the face 
of the Christ himself,
Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies.


AS TOILSOME I WANDER'D VIRGINIA'S WOODS.

AS toilsome I wander'd Virginia's woods,
To the music of rustling leaves kick'd by my feet, (for 'twas 
autumn,)
I mark'd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier;
Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat, (easily all could 
I understand,)
The halt of a midday hour, when up! no time to lose—yet this 
sign left,
On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd on the tree by the grave,
Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.

Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering,
Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life,


                                      



Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt, alone,
or in the crowded street,
Comes before me the unknown soldier's grave, comes the inscrip
tion rude in Virginia's woods,
Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.


NOT THE PILOT.

NOT the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port,
though beaten back and many times baffled;
Not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long,
By deserts parch'd, snows chill'd, rivers wet, perseveres till he 
reaches his destination,
More than I have charged myself, heeded or unheeded, to com
pose a march for these States,
For a battlecall, rousing to arms if need be, years, centuries 
hence.


YEAR THAT TREMBLED AND REEL'D BENEATH ME.

YEAR that trembled and reel'd beneath me!
Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed 
froze me,
A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me,
Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself,
Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?
And sullen hymns of defeat?


THE WOUNDDRESSER.



AN old man bending I come among new faces,
Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,
Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love 
me,
(Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge 
relentless war,
But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd 
myself,
To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the 
dead;)
Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these 
chances,


                                      



Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was 
equally brave;)
Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,
Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?
What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,
Of hardfought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest 
remains?




O maidens and young men I love and that love me,
What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your 
talking recalls,
Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and 
dust,
In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in 
the rush of successful charge,
Enter the captur'd works—yet lo, like a swiftrunning river they 
fade,
Pass and are gone they fade—I dwell not on soldiers' perils or 
soldiers' joys,
(Both I remember well—many the hardships, few the joys, yet I 
was content.)

But in silence, in dreams' projections,
While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,
So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off 
the sand,
With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up 
there,
Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)

Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,
Straight and swift to my wounded I go,
Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,
Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground,
Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital,
To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,
To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,
An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,
Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill'd 
again.

I onward go, I stop,
With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,
I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,


                                      



One turns to me his appealing eyes—poor boy! I never knew 
you,
Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that 
would save you.




On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)
The crush'd head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage 
away,)
The neck of the cavalryman with the bullet through and through 
I examine,
Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life 
struggles hard,
(Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!
In mercy come quickly.)

From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,
I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter 
and blood,
Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and side
falling head,
His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the 
bloody stump,
And has not yet look'd on it.

I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,
But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,
And the yellowblue countenance see.

I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bulletwound,
Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sicken
ing, so offensive,
While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and 
pail.

I am faithful, I do not give out,
The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,
These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my 
breast a fire, a burning flame.)




Thus in silence in dreams' projections,
Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,
The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,
I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,


                                      



Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,
(Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and 
rested,
Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)



LONG, TOO LONG AMERICA.

LONG, too long America,
Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn'd from joys and 
prosperity only,
But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish, advancing, grap
pling with direst fate and recoiling not,
And now to conceive and show to the world what your children 
enmasse really are,
(For who except myself has yet conceiv'd what your children 
enmasse really are?)


GIVE ME THE SPLENDID SILENT SUN.



GIVE me the splendid silent sun with all his beams fulldazzling,
Give me juicy autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard,
Give me a field where the unmow'd grass grows,
Give me an arbor, give me the trellis'd grape,
Give me fresh corn and wheat, give me serenemoving animals 
teaching content,
Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the 
Mississippi, and I looking up at the stars,
Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I 
can walk undisturb'd,
Give me for marriage a sweetbreath'd woman of whom I should 
never tire,
Give me a perfect child, give me away aside from the noise of the 
world a rural domestic life,
Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself, for my 
own ears only,
Give me solitude, give me Nature, give me again O Nature your 
primal sanities!

These demanding to have them, (tired with ceaseless excitement, 
and rack'd by the warstrife,)
These to procure incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,
While yet incessantly asking still I adhere to my city,


                                      



Day upon day and year upon year O city, walking your streets,
Where you hold me enchain'd a certain time refusing to give me 
up,
Yet giving to make me glutted, enrich'd of soul, you give me 
forever faces;
(O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries,
I see my own soul trampling down what it ask'd for.)




Keep your splendid silent sun,
Keep your woods O Nature, and the quiet places by the 
woods,
Keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your cornfields and 
orchards,
Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields where the Ninthmonth 
bees hum;
Give me faces and streets—give me these phantoms incessant 
and endless along the trottoirs!
Give me interminable eyes—give me women—give me comrades 
and lovers by the thousand!
Let me see new ones every day—let me hold new ones by the 
hand every day!
Give me such shows—give me the streets of Manhattan!
Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching—give me the 
sound of the trumpets and drums!
(The soldiers in companies or regiments—some starting away, 
flush'd and reckless,
Some, their time up, returning with thinn'd ranks, young, yet very 
old, worn, marching, noticing nothing;)
Give me the shores and wharves heavyfringed with black 
ships!
O such for me! O an intense life, full to repletion and varied!
The life of the theatre, barroom, huge hotel, for me!
The saloon of the steamer! the crowded excursion for me! the 
torchlight procession!
The dense brigade bound for the war, with high piled military 
wagons following;
People, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants,
Manhattan streets with their powerful throbs, with beating drums 
as now,
The endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets, 
(even the sight of the wounded,)
Manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical chorus!
Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me.




                                      




DIRGE FOR TWO VETERANS.

   THE last sunbeam
Lightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,
On the pavement here, and there beyond it is looking,
   Down a newmade double grave.

   LO, the moon ascending,
Up from the east the silvery round moon,
Beautiful over the housetops, ghastly, phantom moon,
   Immense and silent moon.

   I see a sad procession,
And I hear the sound of coming fullkey'd bugles,
All the channels of the city streets they're flooding,
   As with voices and with tears.

   I hear the great drums pounding,
And the small drums steady whirring,
And every blow of the great convulsive drums,
   Strikes me through and through.

   For the son is brought with the father,
(In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell,
Two veterans son and father dropt together,
   And the double grave awaits them.)

   Now nearer blow the bugles,
And the drums strike more convulsive,
And the daylight o'er the pavement quite has faded,
   And the strong deadmarch enwraps me.

   In the eastern sky upbuoying,
The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin'd,
('Tis some mother's large transparent face,
   In heaven brighter growing.)

   O strong deadmarch you please me!
O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me!
O my soldiers twain! O my veterans passing to burial!
   What I have I also give you.

   The moon gives you light,
And the bugles and the drums give you music,
And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,
   My heart gives you love.



                                      




OVER THE CARNAGE ROSE PROPHETIC A VOICE.

OVER the carnage rose prophetic a voice,
Be not dishearten'd, affection shall solve the problems of freedom 
yet,
Those who love each other shall become invincible,
They shall yet make Columbia victorious.

Sons of the Mother of All, you shall yet be victorious,
You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of 
the earth.

No danger shall balk Columbia's lovers,
If need be a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one.

One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian's comrade,
From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another an Oregonese,
shall be friends triune,
More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth.

To Michigan, Florida perfumes shall tenderly come,
Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death.

It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly 
affection,
The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly,
The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,
The continuance of Equality shall be comrades.

These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron,
I, ecstatic, O partners! O lands! with the love of lovers tie you.

(Were you looking to be held together by lawyers?
Or by an agreement on a paper? or by arms?
Nay, nor the world, nor any living thing, will so cohere.)


I SAW OLD GENERAL AT BAY.

I SAW old General at bay,
(Old as he was, his gray eyes yet shone out in battle like stars,)
His small force was now completely hemm'd in, in his works,
He call'd for volunteers to run the enemy's lines, a desperate 
emergency,
I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks, but two or 
three were selected,


                                      



I saw them receive their orders aside, they listen'd with care, the 
adjutant was very grave,
I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives.


THE ARTILLERYMAN'S VISION.

WHILE my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over 
long,
And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the vacant mid
night passes,
And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear, the 
breath of my infant,
There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me;
The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal,
The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear the 
irregular snap! snap!
I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short tht! tht! 
of the rifleballs,
I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear the 
great shells shrieking as they pass,
The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees,
(tumultuous now the contest rages,)
All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again,
The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their pieces,
The chiefgunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of 
the right time,
After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the 
effect;
Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young 
colonel leads himself this time with brandish'd sword,)
I see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, (quickly fill'd up, no 
delay,)
I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover low 
concealing all;
Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either side,
Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls and 
orders of officers,
While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my 
ears a shout of applause, (some special success,)
And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even in 
dreams a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the 
depths of my soul,)
And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions, batteries,
cavalry, moving hither and thither,


                                      



(The falling, dying, I heed not, the wounded dripping and red I 
heed not, some to the rear are hobbling,)
Grime, heat, rush, aidedecamps galloping by or on a full run,
With the patter of small arms, the warning sst of the rifles, (these 
in my vision I hear or see,)
And bombs bursting in air, and at night the varicolor'd rockets.


ETHIOPIA SALUTING THE COLORS.

WHO are you dusky woman, so ancient hardly human,
With your woollywhite and turban'd head, and bare bony feet?
Why rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?

('Tis while our army lines Carolina's sands and pines,
Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com'st to me,
As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea.)

Me master years a hundred since from my parents sunder'd,
A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught,
Then hither me across the sea the cruel slaver brought.

No further does she say, but lingering all the day,
Her highborne turban'd head she wags, and rolls her darkling 
eye,
And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving by.

What is it fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?
Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red and green?
Are the things so strange and marvelous you see or have seen?


NOT YOUTH PERTAINS TO ME.

NOT youth pertains to me,
Nor delicatesse, I cannot beguile the time with talk,
Awkward in the parlor, neither a dancer nor elegant,
In the learn'd coterie sitting constrain'd and still, for learning 
inures not to me,
Beauty, knowledge, inure not to me—yet there are two or three 
things inure to me,
I have nourish'd the wounded and sooth'd many a dying soldier,
And at intervals waiting or in the midst of camp,
Composed these songs.



                                      




RACE OF VETERANS.

RACE of veterans—race of victors!
Race of the soil, ready for conflict—race of the conquering march!
(No more credulity's race, abidingtemper'd race,)
Race henceforth owning no law but the law of itself,
Race of passion and the storm.


WORLD TAKE GOOD NOTICE.

WORLD take good notice, silver stars fading,
Milky hue ript, weft of white detaching,
Coals thirtyeight, baleful and burning,
Scarlet, significant, hands off warning,
Now and henceforth flaunt from these shores.


O TANFACED PRAIRIEBOY.

O TANFACED prairieboy,
Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift,
Praises and presents came and nourishing food, till at last among 
the recruits,
You came, taciturn, with nothing to give—we but look'd on each 
other,
When lo! more than all the gifts of the world you gave me.


LOOK DOWN FAIR MOON.

LOOK down fair moon and bathe this scene,
Pour softly down night's nimbus floods on faces ghastly, swollen,
purple,
On the dead on their backs with arms toss'd wide,
Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon.


RECONCILIATION.

WORD over all, beautiful as the sky,
Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be 
utterly lost,
That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly 
wash again, and ever again, this soil'd world;


                                      



For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,
I look where he lies whitefaced and still in the coffin—I draw 
near,
Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the 
coffin.


HOW SOLEMN AS ONE BY ONE.
(Washington City, .)

HOW solemn as one by one,
As the ranks returning worn and sweaty, as the men file by where 
I stand,
As the faces the masks appear, as I glance at the faces studying the 
masks,
(As I glance upward out of this page studying you, dear friend,
whoever you are,)
How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the 
ranks, and to you,
I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul,
O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,
Nor the bayonet stab what you really are;
The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,
Waiting secure and content, which the bullet could never kill,
Nor the bayonet stab O friend.


AS I LAY WITH MY HEAD IN YOUR LAP CAMERADO.

AS I lay with my head in your lap camerado,
The confession I made I resume, what I said to you and the open 
air I resume,
I know I am restless and make others so,
I know my words are weapons full of danger, full of death,
For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle 
them,
I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever 
have been had all accepted me,
I heed not and have never heeded either experience, cautions,
majorities, nor ridicule,
And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me,
And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing to me;
Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and 
still urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,
Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and defeated.



                                      




DELICATE CLUSTER.

DELICATE cluster! flag of teeming life!
Covering all my lands—all my seashores lining!
Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke of battle 
pressing!
How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)
Flag cerulean—sunny flag, with the orbs of night dappled!
Ah my silvery beauty—ah my woolly white and crimson!
Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty!
My sacred one, my mother.


TO A CERTAIN CIVILIAN.

DID you ask dulcet rhymes from me?
Did you seek the civilian's peaceful and languishing rhymes?
Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow?
Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to understand—
nor am I now;
(I have been born of the same as the war was born,
The drumcorps' rattle is ever to me sweet music, I love well the 
martial dirge,
With slow wail and convulsive throb leading the officer's funeral;)
What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I? therefore leave my 
works,
And go lull yourself with what you can understand, and with piano
tunes,
For I lull nobody, and you will never understand me.


LO, VICTRESS ON THE PEAKS.

LO, Victress on the peaks,
Where thou with mighty brow regarding the world,
(The world O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee,)
Out of its countless beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all,
Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,
Flauntest now unharm'd in immortal soundness and bloom—lo, in 
these hours supreme,
No poem proud, I chanting bring to thee, nor mastery's rapturous 
verse,
But a cluster containing night's darkness and blooddripping 
wounds,
And psalms of the dead.



                                      




SPIRIT WHOSE WORK IS DONE.
(Washington City, .)

SPIRIT whose work is done—spirit of dreadful hours!
Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets;
Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever unfaltering 
pressing,)
Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene—electric 
spirit,
That with muttering voice through the war now closed, like a tire
less phantom flitted,
Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat 
the drum,
Now as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,
reverberates round me,
As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles,
As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders,
As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders,
As those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them appearing in the 
distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,
Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro to the right and 
left,
Evenly lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time;
Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death 
next day,
Touch my mouth ere you depart, press my lips close,
Leave me your pulses of rage—bequeath them to me—fill me 
with currents convulsive,
Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone,
Let them identify you to the future in these songs.


ADIEU TO A SOLDIER.

ADIEU O soldier,
You of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,)
The rapid march, the life of the camp,
The hot contention of opposing fronts, the long manoeuvre,
Red battles with their slaughter, the stimulus, the strong terrific 
game,
Spell of all brave and manly hearts, the trains of time through you 
and like of you all fill'd,
With war and war's expression.

Adieu dear comrade,
Your mission is fulfill'd—but I, more warlike,


                                      



Myself and this contentious soul of mine,
Still on our own campaigning bound,
Through untried roads with ambushes opponents lined,
Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis, often baffled,
Here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out—aye here,
To fiercer, weightier battles give expression.


TURN O LIBERTAD.

TURN O Libertad, for the war is over,
From it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no more, resolute,
sweeping the world,
Turn from lands retrospective recording proofs of the past,
From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past,
From the chants of the feudal world, the triumphs of kings, slavery,
caste,
Turn to the world, the triumphs reserv'd and to come—give up 
that backward world,
Leave to the singers of hitherto, give them the trailing past,
But what remains remains for singers for you—wars to come are 
for you,
(Lo, how the wars of the past have duly inured to you, and the 
wars of the present also inure;)
Then turn, and be not alarm'd O Libertad—turn your undying 
face,
To where the future, greater than all the past,
Is swiftly, surely preparing for you.


TO THE LEAVEN'D SOIL THEY TROD.

TO the leaven'd soil they trod calling I sing for the last,
(Forth from my tent emerging for good, loosing, untying the tent
ropes,)
In the freshness the forenoon air, in the farstretching circuits and 
vistas again to peace restored,
To the fiery fields emanative and the endless vistas beyond, to the 
South and the North,
To the leaven'd soil of the general Western world to attest my 
songs,
To the Alleghanian hills and the tireless Mississippi,
To the rocks I calling sing, and all the trees in the woods,
To the plains of the poems of heroes, to the prairies spreading 
wide,


                                      



To the faroff sea and the unseen winds, and the sane impalpable 
air;
And responding they answer all, (but not in words,)
The average earth, the witness of war and peace, acknowledges 
mutely,
The prairie draws me close, as the father to bosom broad the son,
The Northern ice and rain that began me nourish me to the end,
But the hot sun of the South is to fully ripen my songs.

MEMORIES OF PRESIDENT 
LINCOLN.



—————


WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D.



WHEN lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd,
And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the night,
I mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with everreturning spring.

Everreturning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,
Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,
And thought of him I love.




O powerful western fallen star!
O shades of night—O moody, tearful night!
O great star disappear'd—O the black murk that hides the star!
O cruel hands that hold me powerless—O helpless soul of me!
O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.




In the dooryard fronting an old farmhouse near the whitewash'd 
palings,
Stands the lilacbush tallgrowing with heartshaped leaves of rich 
green,
With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume 
strong I love,


                                      



With every leaf a miracle—and from this bush in the dooryard,
With delicatecolor'd blossoms and heartshaped leaves of rich 
green,
A sprig with its flower I break.




In the swamp in secluded recesses,
A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.

Solitary the thrush,
The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,
Sings by himself a song.

Song of the bleeding throat,
Death's outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know,
If thou wast not granted to sing thou would'st surely die.)




Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,
Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep'd 
from the ground, spotting the gray debris,
Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the 
endless grass,
Passing the yellowspear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in 
the darkbrown fields uprisen,
Passing the appletree blows of white and pink in the orchards,
Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,
Night and day journeys a coffin.




Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,
Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land,
With the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in black,
With the show of the States themselves as of crapeveil'd women 
standing,
With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,
With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the 
unbared heads,
With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,
With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising 
strong and solemn,
With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the coffin,
The dimlit churches and the shuddering organs—where amid 
these you journey,


                                      



With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,
Here, coffin that slowly passes,
I give you my sprig of lilac.




(Nor for you, for one alone,
Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring,
For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O 
sane and sacred death.

All over bouquets of roses,
O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies,
But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,
Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,
With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,
For you and the coffins all of you O death.)




O western orb sailing the heaven,
Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I 
walk'd,
As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,
As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after 
night,
As you droop'd from the sky low down as if to my side, (while 
the other stars all look'd on,)
As we wander'd together the solemn night, (for something I know 
not what kept me from sleep,)
As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full 
you were of woe,
As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool trans
parent night,
As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward 
black of the night,
As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb,
Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.




Sing on there in the swamp,
O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call,
I hear, I come presently, I understand you,
But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd me,
The star my departing comrade holds and detains me.




                                      





O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?
And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has 
gone?
And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?

Seawinds blown from east and west,
Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till 
there on the prairies meeting,
These and with these and the breath of my chant,
I'll perfume the grave of him I love.




O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?
And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,
To adorn the burialhouse of him I love?

Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,
With the Fourthmonth eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid 
and bright,
With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking 
sun, burning, expanding the air,
With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves 
of the trees prolific,
In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a 
winddapple here and there,
With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, 
and shadows,
And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chim
neys,
And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen 
homeward returning.




Lo, body and soul—this land,
My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying 
tides, and the ships,
The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light, 
Ohio's shores and flashing Missouri,
And ever the farspreading prairies cover'd with grass and corn.

Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,
The violet and purple morn with justfelt breezes,
The gentle softborn measureless light,


                                      



The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill'd noon,
The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,
Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.




Sing on, sing on you graybrown bird,
Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the 
bushes,
Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.

Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,
Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.

O liquid and free and tender!
O wild and loose to my soul—O wondrous singer!
You only I hear—yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,)
Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.




Now while I sat in the day and look'd forth,
In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and 
the farmers preparing their crops,
In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and 
forests,
In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb'd winds and the 
storms,)
Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the 
voices of children and women,
The manymoving seatides, and I saw the ships how they 
sail'd,
And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy 
with labor,
And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with 
its meals and minutia of daily usages,
And the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities pent 
—lo, then and there,
Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the 
rest,
Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail,
And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of 
death.

Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,
And the thought of death closewalking the other side of me,


                                      



And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the 
hands of companions,
I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,
Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the 
dimness,
To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.

And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me,
The graybrown bird I know receiv'd us comrades three,
And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.

From deep secluded recesses,
From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,
Came the carol of the bird.

And the charm of the carol rapt me,
As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,
And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.

Come lovely and soothing death,
Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,
In the day, in the night, to all, to each,
Sooner or later delicate death.

Prais'd be the fathomless universe,
For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,
And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise!
For the sureenwinding arms of coolenfolding death.

Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,
Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?
Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,
I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfal
teringly.

Approach strong deliveress,
When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,
Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,
Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death.

From me to thee glad serenades,
Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feast
ings for thee,
And the sights of the open landscape and the highspread sky are 
fitting,
And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.



                                      



The night in silence under many a star,
The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I 
know,
And the soul turning to thee O vast and wellveil'd death,
And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.

Over the treetops I float thee a song,
Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the 
prairies wide,
Over the densepack'd cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,
I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death.




To the tally of my soul,
Loud and strong kept up the graybrown bird,
With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.

Loud in the pines and cedars dim,
Clear in the freshness moist and the swampperfume,
And I with my comrades there in the night.

While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,
As to long panoramas of visions.

And I saw askant the armies,
I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battleflags,
Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles 
I saw them,
And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and 
bloody,
And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)
And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.

I saw battlecorpses, myriads of them,
And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,
I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,
But I saw they were not as was thought,
They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,
The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,
And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,
And the armies that remain'd suffer'd.




Passing the visions, passing the night,
Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,


                                      



Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my 
soul,
Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying everaltering song,
As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding 
the night,
Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again 
bursting with joy,
Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,
As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,
Passing, I leave thee lilac with heartshaped leaves,
I leave thee there in the dooryard, blooming, returning with 
spring.

I cease from my song for thee,
From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing 
with thee,
O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.

Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,
The song, the wondrous chant of the graybrown bird,
And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,
With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full 
of woe,
With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,
Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to 
keep, for the dead I loved so well,
For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands—and this 
for his dear sake,
Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,
There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.



O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!

O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
   But O heart! heart! heart!
     O the bleeding drops of red,
       Where on the deck my Captain lies,
         Fallen cold and dead.

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,


                                      



For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores 
acrowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
   Here Captain! dear father!
     This arm beneath your head!
       It is some dream that on the deck,
         You've fallen cold and dead.

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
   Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
     But I with mournful tread,
       Walk the deck my Captain lies,
         Fallen cold and dead.


HUSH'D BE THE CAMPS TODAY.
(May , .)

HUSH'D be the camps today,
And soldiers let us drape our warworn weapons,
And each with musing soul retire to celebrate,
Our dear commander's death.

No more for him life's stormy conflicts,
Nor victory, nor defeat—no more time's dark events,
Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.

But sing poet in our name,
Sing of the love we bore him—because you, dweller in camps,
know it truly.

As they invault the coffin there,
Sing—as they close the doors of earth upon him—one verse,
For the heavy hearts of soldiers.


THIS DUST WAS ONCE THE MAN.

THIS dust was once the man,
Gentle, plain, just and resolute, under whose cautious hand,
Against the foulest crime in history known in any land or age,
Was saved the Union of these States.


                                      




BY BLUE ONTARIO'S SHORE.



BY blue Ontario's shore,
As I mused of these warlike days and of peace return'd, and the 
dead that return no more,
A Phantom gigantic superb, with stern visage accosted me,
Chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of America, 
chant me the carol of victory,
And strike up the marches of Libertad, marches more powerful yet,
And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy.

(Democracy, the destin'd conqueror, yet treacherous lipsmiles 
everywhere,
And death and infidelity at every step.)




A Nation announcing itself,
I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,
I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.

A breed whose proof is in time and deeds,
What we are we are, nativity is answer enough to objections,
We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,
We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,
We are executive in ourselves, we are sufficient in the variety of 
ourselves,
We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves,
We stand selfpois'd in the middle, branching thence over the 
world,
From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.

Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,
Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or 
sinful in ourselves only.

(O Mother—O Sisters dear!
If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us,
It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)




Have you thought there could be but a single supreme?
There can be any number of supremes—one does not counter
vail another any more than one eyesight countervails 
another, or one life countervails another.



                                      



All is eligible to all,
All is for individuals, all is for you,
No condition is prohibited, not God's or any.

All comes by the body, only health puts you rapport with the 
universe.

Produce great Persons, the rest follows.




Piety and conformity to them that like,
Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like,
I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,
Crying, Leap from your seats and contend for your lives!

I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue, questioning 
every one I meet,
Who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew before?
Who are you that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?

(With pangs and cries as thine own O bearer of many children,
These clamors wild to a race of pride I give.)

O lands, would you be freer than all that has ever been before?
If you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen 
to me.

Fear grace, elegance, civilization, delicatesse,
Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honeyjuice,
Beware the advancing mortal ripening of Nature,
Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and 
men.




Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected 
materials,
America brings builders, and brings its own styles.

The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work 
and pass'd to other spheres,
A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.

America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at 
all hazards,


                                      



Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound, initiates the true 
use of precedents,
Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced 
under their forms,
Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne 
from the house,
Perceives that it waits a little while in the door, that it was fittest 
for its days,
That its life has descended to the stalwart and wellshaped heir 
who approaches,
And that he shall be fittest for his days.

Any period one nation must lead,
One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.

These States are the amplest poem,
Here is not merely a nation but a teeming Nation of nations,
Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of 
the day and night,
Here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of particulars,
Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the soul 
loves,
Here the flowing trains, here the crowds, equality, diversity, the 
soul loves.




Land of lands and bards to corroborate!
Of them standing among them, one lifts to the light a westbred 
face,
To him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd both mother's and 
father's,
His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,
Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,
Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,
Attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on its neck with 
incomparable love,
Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,
Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him,
Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,
Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes, Columbia,
Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,
If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch, he stretch
ing with them North or South,
Spanning between them East and West, and touching whatever is 
between them,


                                      



Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine, cedar,
hemlock, liveoak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood,
orange, magnolia,
Tangles as tangled in him as any canebrake or swamp,
He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with 
northern transparent ice,
Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,
Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish
hawk, mockingbird, nightheron, and eagle,
His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and 
evil,
Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present 
times,
Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,
Weatherbeaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and 
muscle,
The haughty defiance of the Year One, war, peace, the formation 
of the Constitution,
The separate States, the simple elastic scheme, the immigrants,
The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure and 
impregnable,
The unsurvey'd interior, loghouses, clearings, wild animals, hunt
ers, trappers,
Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the 
gestation of new States,
Congress convening every Twelfthmonth, the members duly 
coming up from the uttermost parts,
Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, espe
cially the young men,
Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships, the gait they 
have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the 
presence of superiors,
The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness 
and decision of their phrenology,
The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when 
wrong'd,
The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,
good temper and openhandedness, the whole composite 
make,
The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,
The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid move
ment of the population,
The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, golddig
ging,
Wharfhemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all 
points,


                                      



Factories, mercantile life, laborsaving machinery, the Northeast,
Northwest, Southwest,
Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,
Slavery—the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon 
the ruins of all the rest,
On and on to the grapple with it—Assassin! then your life or 
ours be the stake, and respite no more.




(Lo, high toward heaven, this day,
Libertad, from the conqueress' field return'd,
I mark the new aureola around your head,
No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,
With war's flames and the lambent lightnings playing,
And your port immovable where you stand,
With still the inextinguishable glance and the clinch'd and lifted fist,
And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner 
utterly crush'd beneath you,
The menacing arrogant one that strode and advanced with his 
senseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife,
The wideswelling one, the braggart that would yesterday do so 
much,
Today a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth,
An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn'd.)




Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive and ever 
keeps vista,
Others adorn the past, but you O days of the present, I adorn 
you,
O days of the future I believe in you—I isolate myself for your 
sake,
O America because you build for mankind I build for you,
O wellbeloved stonecutters, I lead them who plan with decision 
and science,
Lead the present with friendly hand toward the future.

(Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age!
But damn that which spends itself with no thought of the stain,
pains, dismay, feebleness, it is bequeathing.)




I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore,
I heard the voice arising demanding bards,



                                      



By them all native and grand, by them alone can these States be 
fused into the compact organism of a Nation.

To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no 
account,
That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living 
principle, as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres 
of plants.

Of all races and eras these States with veins full of poetical stuff 
most need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use 
them the greatest,
Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as 
their poets shall.

(Soul of love and tongue of fire!
Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world!
Ah Mother, prolific and full in all besides, yet how long barren,
barren?)




Of these States the poet is the equable man,
Not in him but off from him things are grotesque, eccentric, fail 
of their full returns,
Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,
He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither 
more nor less,
He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,
He is the equalizer of his age and land,
He supplies what wants supplying, he checks what wants checking,
In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty,
building populous towns, encouraging agriculture, arts,
commerce, lighting the study of man, the soul, health,
immortality, government,
In war he is the best backer of the war, he fetches artillery as good 
as the engineer's, he can make every word he speaks draw 
blood,
The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady 
faith,
He is no arguer, he is judgment, (Nature accepts him absolutely,)
He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun falling round a 
helpless thing,
As he sees the farthest he has the most faith,
His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,
In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,


                                      



He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,
He sees eternity in men and women, he does not see men and 
women as dreams or dots.

For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,
For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,
The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.

Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,
They live in the feelings of young men and the best women,
(Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been 
always ready to fall for Liberty.)




For the great Idea,
That, O my brethren, that is the mission of poets.

Songs of stern defiance ever ready,
Songs of the rapid arming and the march,
The flag of peace quickfolded, and instead the flag we know,
Warlike flag of the great Idea.

(Angry cloth I saw there leaping!
I stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting,
I sing you over all, flying beckoning through the fight—O the 
hardcontested fight!
The cannons ope their rosyflashing muzzles—the hurtled balls 
scream,
The battlefront forms amid the smoke—the volleys pour incessant 
from the line,
Hark, the ringing word Charge!—now the tussle and the furious 
maddening yells,
Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground,
Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,
Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)




Are you he who would assume a place to teach or be a poet here 
in the States?
The place is august, the terms obdurate.

Who would assume to teach here may well prepare himself body 
and mind,
He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe him
self,
He shall surely be question'd beforehand by me with many and 
stern questions.



                                      



Who are you indeed who would talk or sing to America?
Have you studied out the land, its idioms and men?
Have you learn'd the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography,
pride, freedom, friendship of the land? its substratums and 
objects?
Have you consider'd the organic compact of the first day of the 
first year of Independence, sign'd by the Commissioners,
ratified by the States, and read by Washington at the head 
of the army?
Have you possess'd yourself of the Federal Constitution?
Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind 
them, and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy?
Are you faithful to things? do you teach what the land and sea,
the bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness, heroic angers,
teach?
Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?
Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls, fierce 
contentions? are you very strong? are you really of the 
whole People?
Are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion?
Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now 
to life itself?
Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of these States?
Have you too the old everfresh forbearance and impartiality?
Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity? for the 
lastborn? little and big? and for the errant?

What is this you bring my America?
Is it uniform with my country?
Is it not something that has been better told or done before?
Have you not imported this or the spirit of it in some ship?
Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness?—is the good old 
cause in it?
Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,
literats, of enemies' lands?
Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?
Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?
Does it sound with trumpetvoice the proud victory of the Union 
in that secession war?
Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?
Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air, to appear again in my 
strength, gait, face?
Have real employments contributed to it? original makers, not 
mere amanuenses?
Does it meet modern discoveries, calibres, facts, face to face?


                                      



What does it mean to American persons, progresses, cities? Chi
cago, Kanada, Arkansas?
Does it see behind the apparent custodians the real custodians 
standing, menacing, silent, the mechanics, Manhattanese,
Western men, Southerners, significant alike in their apathy,
and in the promptness of their love?
Does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen, each 
temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist, infidel,
who has ever ask'd any thing of America?
What mocking and scornful negligence?
The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons,
By the roadside others disdainfully toss'd.




Rhymes and rhymers pass away, poems distill'd from poems pass 
away,
The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes,
Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soil of litera
ture,
America justifies itself, give it time, no disguise can deceive it or 
conceal from it, it is impassive enough,
Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,
If its poets appear it will in due time advance to meet them,
there is no fear of mistake,
(The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd till his country 
absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd it.)

He masters whose spirit masters, he tastes sweetest who results 
sweetest in the long run,
The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;
In the need of songs, philosophy, an appropriate native grand
opera, shipcraft, any craft,
He or she is greatest who contributes the greatest original prac
tical example.

Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the 
streets,
People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive knowers,
There will shortly be no more priests, I say their work is done,
Death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emer
gencies here,
Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be 
superb,
Justice, health, selfesteem, clear the way with irresistible power;
How dare you place any thing before a man?




                                      





Fall behind me States!
A man before all—myself, typical, before all.

Give me the pay I have served for,
Give me to sing the songs of the great Idea, take all the rest,
I have loved the earth, sun, animals, I have despised riches,
I have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for the stupid 
and crazy, devoted my income and labor to others,
Hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience and 
indulgence toward the people, taken off my hat to nothing 
known or unknown,
Gone freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young,
and with the mothers of families,
Read these leaves to myself in the open air, tried them by trees,
stars, rivers,
Dismiss'd whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body,
Claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd for 
others on the same terms,
Sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every 
State,
(Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd to breathe his 
last,
This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored,
To life recalling many a prostrate form;)
I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste 
of myself,
Rejecting none, permitting all.

(Say O Mother, have I not to your thought been faithful?
Have I not through life kept you and yours before me?)




I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things,
It is not the earth, it is not America who is so great,
It is I who am great or to be great, it is You up there, or any one,
It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,
Through poems, pageants, shows, to form individuals.

Underneath all, individuals,
I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,
The American compact is altogether with individuals,
The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,
The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one 
single individual—namely to You.



                                      



(Mother! with subtle sense severe, with the naked sword in your 
hand,
I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)




Underneath all, Nativity,
I swear I will stand by my own nativity, pious or impious so be it;
I swear I am charm'd with nothing except nativity,
Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity.

Underneath all is the Expression of love for men and women,
(I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of 
expressing love for men and women,
After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men 
and women.)

I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself,
(Talk as you like, he only suits these States whose manners favor 
the audacity and sublime turbulence of the States.)

Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,
ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,
Underneath all to me is myself, to you yourself, (the same monoto
nous old song.)




O I see flashing that this America is only you and me,
Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,
Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, are you and me,
Its Congress is you and me, the officers, capitols, armies, ships, are 
you and me,
Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,
The war, (that war so bloody and grim, the war I will henceforth 
forget), was you and me,
Natural and artificial are you and me,
Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me,
Past, present, future, are you and me.

I dare not shirk any part of myself,
Not any part of America good or bad,
Not to build for that which builds for mankind,
Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,
Not to justify science nor the march of equality,
Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn belov'd of time.



                                      



I am for those that have never been master'd,
For men and women whose tempers have never been master'd,
For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master.

I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth,
Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all.

I will not be outfaced by irrational things,
I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me,
I will make cities and civilizations defer to me,
This is what I have learnt from America—it is the amount, and it 
I teach again.

(Democracy, while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,
I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children, saw in dreams 
your dilating form,
Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)




I will confront these shows of the day and night,
I will know if I am to be less than they,
I will see if I am not as majestic as they,
I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they,
I will see if I am to be less generous than they,
I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have 
meaning,
I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,
and I am not to be enough for myself.

I match my spirit against yours you orbs, growths, mountains,
brutes,
Copious as you are I absorb you all in myself, and become the 
master myself,
America isolated yet embodying all, what is it finally except 
myself?
These States, what are they except myself?

I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked, it is for my 
sake,
I take you specially to be mine, you terrible, rude forms.

(Mother, bend down, bend close to me your face,
I know not what these plots and wars and deferments are for,
I know not fruition's success, but I know that through war and 
crime your work goes on, and must yet go on.)




                                      





Thus by blue Ontario's shore,
While the winds fann'd me and the waves came trooping toward 
me,
I thrill'd with the power's pulsations, and the charm of my theme 
was upon me,
Till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me.

And I saw the free souls of poets,
The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,
Strange large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to 
me.




O my rapt verse, my call, mock me not!
Not for the bards of the past, not to invoke them have I launch'd 
you forth,
Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores,
Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song.

Bards for my own land only I invoke,
(For the war the war is over, the field is clear'd,)
Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,
To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul.

Bards of the great Idea! bards of the peaceful inventions! (for 
the war, the war is over!)
Yet bards of latent armies, a million soldiers waiting everready,
Bards with songs as from burning coals or the lightning's fork'd 
stripes!
Ample Ohio's, Kanada's bards—bards of California! inland 
bards—bards of the war!
You by my charm I invoke.



REVERSALS.

LET that which stood in front go behind,
Let that which was behind advance to the front,
Let bigots, fools, unclean persons, offer new propositions,
Let the old propositions be postponed,
Let a man seek pleasure everywhere except in himself,
Let a woman seek happiness everywhere except in herself.



                                      




AUTUMN RIVULETS.



—————


AS CONSEQUENT, Etc.

AS consequent from store of summer rains,
Or wayward rivulets in autumn flowing,
Or many a herblined brook's reticulations,
Or subterranean searills making for the sea,
Songs of continued years I sing.

Life's evermodern rapids first, (soon, soon to blend,
With the old streams of death.)

Some threading Ohio's farmfields or the woods,
Some down Colorado's cañons from sources of perpetual snow,
Some halfhid in Oregon, or away southward in Texas,
Some in the north finding their way to Erie, Niagara, Ottawa,
Some to Atlantica's bays, and so to the great salt brine.

In you whoe'er you are my book perusing,
In I myself, in all the world, these currents flowing,
All, all toward the mystic ocean tending.

Currents for starting a continent new,
Overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid,
Fusion of ocean and land, tender and pensive waves,
(Not safe and peaceful only, waves rous'd and ominous too,
Out of the depths the storm's abysmic waves, who knows whence?
Raging over the vast, with many a broken spar and tatter'd sail.)

Or from the sea of Time, collecting vasting all, I bring,
A windrowdrift of weeds and shells.

O little shells, so curiousconvolute, so limpidcold and voiceless,
Will you not little shells to the tympans of temples held,
Murmurs and echoes still call up, eternity's music faint and far,
Wafted inland, sent from Atlantica's rim, strains for the soul of the 
prairies,
Whisper'd reverberations, chords for the ear of the West joyously 
sounding,
Your tidings old, yet ever new and untranslatable,
Infinitesimals out of my life, and many a life,


                                      



(For not my life and years alone I give—all, all I give,)
These waifs from the deep, cast high and dry,
Wash'd on America's shores?


THE RETURN OF THE HEROES.



FOR the lands and for these passionate days and for myself,
Now I awhile retire to thee O soil of autumn fields,
Reclining on thy breast, giving myself to thee,
Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart,
Tuning a verse for thee.

O earth that hast no voice, confide to me a voice,
O harvest of my lands—O boundless summer growths,
O lavish brown parturient earth—O infinite teeming womb,
A song to narrate thee.




Ever upon this stage,
Is acted God's calm annual drama,
Gorgeous processions, songs of birds,
Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul,
The heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, strong 
waves,
The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering trees,
The liliput countless armies of the grass,
The heat, the showers, the measureless pasturages,
The scenery of the snows, the winds' free orchestra,
The stretching lighthung roof of clouds, the clear cerulean and 
the silvery fringes,
The high dilating stars, the placid beckoning stars,
The moving flocks and herds, the plains and emerald meadows,
The shows of all the varied lands and all the growths and products.




Fecund America—today,
Thou art all over set in births and joys!
Thou groan'st with riches, thy wealth clothes thee as a swathing
garment,
Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions,
A myriadtwining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast 
demesne,


                                      



As some huge ship freighted to water's edge thou ridest into 
port,
As rain falls from the heaven and vapors rise from earth, so have 
the precious values fallen upon thee and risen out of thee;
Thou envy of the globe! thou miracle!
Thou, bathed, choked, swimming in plenty,
Thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns,
Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon 
thy world, and lookest East and lookest West,
Dispensatress, that by a word givest a thousand miles, a million 
farms, and missest nothing,
Thou allacceptress—thou hospitable, (thou only art hospitable as 
God is hospitable.)




When late I sang sad was my voice,
Sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred 
and smoke of war;
In the midst of the conflict, the heroes, I stood,
Or pass'd with slow step through the wounded and dying.

But now I sing not war,
Nor the measur'd march of soldiers, nor the tents of camps,
Nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle;
No more the sad, unnatural shows of war.

Ask'd room those flush'd immortal ranks, the first forthstepping 
armies?
Ask room alas the ghastly ranks, the armies dread that follow'd.

(Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, with your tramping sinewy legs,
With your shoulders young and strong, with your knapsacks and 
your muskets;
How elate I stood and watch'd you, where starting off you 
march'd.

Pass—then rattle drums again,
For an army heaves in sight, O another gathering army,
Swarming, trailing on the rear, O you dread accruing army,
O you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea, with your 
fever,
O my land's maim'd darlings, with the plenteous bloody bandage 
and the crutch,
Lo, your pallid army follows.)




                                      





But on these days of brightness,
On the farstretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes, 
the highpiled farmwagons, and the fruits and barns,
Should the dead intrude?

Ah the dead to me mar not, they fit well in Nature,
They fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass,
And along the edge of the sky in the horizon's far margin.

Nor do I forget you Departed,
Nor in winter or summer my lost ones,
But most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at 
peace, like pleasing phantoms,
Your memories rising glide silently by me.




I saw the day the return of the heroes,
(Yet the heroes never surpass'd shall never return,
Them that day I saw not.)

I saw the interminable corps, I saw the processions of armies,
I saw them approaching, defiling by with divisions,
Streaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters 
of mighty camps.

No holiday soldiers—youthful, yet veterans,
Worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and 
workshop,
Harden'd of many a long campaign and sweaty march,
Inured on many a hardfought bloody field.

A pause—the armies wait,
A million flush'd embattled conquerors wait,
The world too waits, then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn,
They melt, they disappear.

Exult O lands! victorious lands!
Not there your victory on those red shuddering fields,
But here and hence your victory.

Melt, melt away ye armies—disperse ye blueclad soldiers,
Resolve ye back again, give up for good your deadly arms,
Other the arms the fields henceforth for you, or South or North,
With saner wars, sweet wars, lifegiving wars.




                                      





Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!
The season of thanks and the voice of fullyielding,
The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.

All till'd and untill'd fields expand before me,
I see the true arenas of my race, or first or last,
Man's innocent and strong arenas.

I see the heroes at other toils,
I see wellwielded in their hands the better weapons.

I see where the Mother of All,
With fullspanning eye gazes forth, dwells long,
And counts the varied gathering of the products.

Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,
Prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the North,
Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane,
Open unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,
Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,
And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook,
And healthy uplands with herbyperfumed breezes,
And the good green grass, that delicate miracle the everrecurring 
grass.




Toil on heroes! harvest the products!
Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All,
With dilated form and lambent eyes watch'd you.

Toil on heroes! toil well! handle the weapons well!
The Mother of All, yet here as ever she watches you.

Wellpleased America thou beholdest,
Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters,
The humandivine inventions, the laborsaving implements;
Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the 
revolving hayrakes,
The steampower reapingmachines and the horsepower machines,
The engines, thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain, well sepa
rating the straw, the nimble work of the patent pitchfork,
Beholdest the newer sawmill, the southern cottongin, and the 
ricecleanser.



                                      



Beneath thy look O Maternal,
With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes 
harvest.

All gather and all harvest,
Yet but for thee O Powerful, not a scythe might swing as now in 
security,
Not a maizestalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace.

Under thee only they harvest, even but a wisp of hay under thy 
great face only,
Harvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, every barbed spear 
under thee,
Harvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, each ear in 
its lightgreen sheath,
Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns,
Oats to their bins, the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, 
to theirs;
Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama, dig and hoard the 
golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,
Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,
Cut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp or tobacco in the 
Borders,
Pick the pea and the bean, or pull apples from the trees or bunches 
of grapes from the vines,
Or aught that ripens in all these States or North or South,
Under the beaming sun and under thee.



THERE WAS A CHILD WENT FORTH.

THERE was a child went forth every day,
And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became,
And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part 
of the day,
Or for many years or stretching cycles of years.

The early lilacs became part of this child,
And grass and white and red morningglories, and white and red 
clover, and the song of the phoebebird,
And the Thirdmonth lambs and the sow's pinkfaint litter, and 
the mare's foal and the cow's calf,
And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond
side,


                                      



And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there, and 
the beautiful curious liquid,
And the waterplants with their graceful flat heads, all became part 
of him.

The fieldsprouts of Fourthmonth and Fifthmonth became part 
of him,
Wintergrain sprouts and those of the lightyellow corn, and the 
esculent roots of the garden,
And the appletrees cover'd with blossoms and the fruit afterward,
and woodberries, and the commonest weeds by the road,
And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the 
tavern whence he had lately risen,
And the schoolmistress that pass'd on her way to the school,
And the friendly boys that pass'd, and the quarrelsome boys,
And the tidy and freshcheek'd girls, and the barefoot negro boy 
and girl,
And all the changes of city and country wherever he went.

His own parents, he that had father'd him and she that had con
ceiv'd him in her womb and birth'd him,
They gave this child more of themselves than that,
They gave him afterward every day, they became part of him.

The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the supper
table,
The mother with mild words, clean her cap and gown, a whole
some odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by,
The father, strong, selfsufficient, manly, mean, anger'd, unjust,
The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,
The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture, the 
yearning and swelling heart,
Affection that will not be gainsay'd, the sense of what is real, the 
thought if after all it should prove unreal,
The doubts of daytime and the doubts of nighttime, the curious 
whether and how,
Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?
Men and women crowding fast in the streets, if they are not flashes 
and specks what are they?
The streets themselves and the façades of houses, and goods in 
the windows,
Vehicles, teams, the heavyplank'd wharves, the huge crossing at 
the ferries,
The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset, the river 
between,


                                      



Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of 
white or brown two miles off,
The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide, the little 
boat slacktow'd astern,
The hurrying tumbling waves, quickbroken crests, slapping,
The strata of color'd clouds, the long bar of maroontint away 
solitary by itself, the spread of purity it lies motionless in,
The horizon's edge, the flying seacrow, the fragrance of salt 
marsh and shore mud,
These became part of that child who went forth every day, and 
who now goes, and will always go forth every day.


OLD IRELAND.

FAR hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty,
Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother,
Once a queen, now lean and tatter'd seated on the ground,
Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders,
At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,
Long silent, she too long silent, mourning her shrouded hope and 
heir,
Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of 
love.

Yet a word ancient mother,
You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with fore
head between your knees,
O you need not sit there veil'd in your old white hair so dishevel'd,
For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave,
It was an illusion, the son you love was not really dead,
The Lord is not dead, he is risen again young and strong in 
another country,
Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave,
What you wept for was translated, pass'd from the grave,
The winds favor'd and the sea sail'd it,
And now with rosy and new blood,
Moves today in a new country.


THE CITY DEADHOUSE.

BY the city deadhouse by the gate,
As idly sauntering wending my way from the clangor,
I curious pause, for lo, an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute 
brought,


                                      



Her corpse they deposit unclaim'd, it lies on the damp brick 
pavement,
The divine woman, her body, I see the body, I look on it alone,
That house once full of passion and beauty, all else I notice not,
Nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odors 
morbific impress me,
But the house alone—that wondrous house—that delicate fair 
house—that ruin!
That immortal house more than all the rows of dwellings ever 
built!
Or whitedomed capitol with majestic figure surmounted, or all 
the old highspired cathedrals,
That little house alone more than them all—poor, desperate 
house!
Fair, fearful wreck—tenement of a soul—itself a soul,
Unclaim'd, avoided house—take one breath from my tremulous 
lips,
Take one tear dropt aside as I go for thought of you,
Dead house of love—house of madness and sin, crumbled,
crush'd,
House of life, erewhile talking and laughing—but ah, poor house,
dead even then,
Months, years, an echoing, garnish'd house—but dead, dead,
dead.


THIS COMPOST.



SOMETHING startles me where I thought I was safest,
I withdraw from the still woods I loved,
I will not go now on the pastures to walk,
I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea,
I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me.

O how can it be that the ground itself does not sicken?
How can you be alive you growths of spring?
How can you furnish health you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, 
grain?
Are they not continually putting distemper'd corpses within you?
Is not every continent work'd over and over with sour dead?

Where have you disposed of their carcasses?
Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations?


                                      



Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?
I do not see any of it upon you today, or perhaps I am deceiv'd,
I will run a furrow with my plough, I will press my spade through 
the sod and turn it up underneath,
I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.




Behold this compost! behold it well!
Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick person—yet 
behold!
The grass of spring covers the prairies,
The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,
The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,
The applebuds cluster together on the applebranches,
The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its 
graves,
The tinge awakes over the willowtree and the mulberrytree,
The hebirds carol mornings and evenings while the shebirds sit 
on their nests,
The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs,
The newborn of animals appear, the calf is dropt from the cow, 
the colt from the mare,
Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's dark green leaves,
Out of its hill rises the yellow maizestalk, the lilacs bloom in the 
dooryards,
The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those 
strata of sour dead.

What chemistry!
That the winds are really not infectious,
That this is no cheat, this transparent greenwash of the sea 
which is so amorous after me,
That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its 
tongues,
That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited 
themselves in it,
That all is clean forever and forever,
That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,
That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,
That the fruits of the appleorchard and the orangeorchard, that 
melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,
That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease,
Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once 
a catching disease.



                                      



Now I am terrified at the Earth, it is that calm and patient,
It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,
It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless 
successions of diseas'd corpses,
It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,
It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptu
ous crops,
It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings 
from them at last.



TO A FOIL'D EUROPEAN REVOLUTIONAIRE.

COURAGE yet, my brother or my sister!
Keep on—Liberty is to be subserv'd whatever occurs;
That is nothing that is quell'd by one or two failures, or any num
ber of failures,
Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any 
unfaithfulness,
Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes.

What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents,
Invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and light, is 
positive and composed, knows no discouragement,
Waiting patiently, waiting its time.

(Not songs of loyalty alone are these,
But songs of insurrection also,
For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over,
And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him,
And stakes his life to be lost at any moment.)

The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance 
and retreat,
The infidel triumphs, or supposes he triumphs,
The prison, scaffold, garroté, handcuffs, iron necklace and lead
balls do their work,
The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,
The great speakers and writers are exiled, they lie sick in distant 
lands,
The cause is asleep, the strongest throats are choked with their 
own blood,
The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground when 
they meet;
But for all this Liberty has not gone out of the place, nor the 
infidel enter'd into full possession.


                                      



When liberty goes out of a place it is not the first to go, nor the 
second or third to go,
It waits for all the rest to go, it is the last.

When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,
And when all life and all the souls of men and women are dis
charged from any part of the earth,
Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from 
that part of the earth,
And the infidel come into full possession.

Then courage European revolter, revoltress!
For till all ceases neither must you cease.

I do not know what you are for, (I do not know what I am for 
myself, nor what any thing is for,)
But I will search carefully for it even in being foil'd,
In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment—for they too 
are great.

Did we think victory great?
So it is—but now it seems to me, when it cannot be help'd, that 
defeat is great,
And that death and dismay are great.


UNNAMED LANDS.

NATIONS ten thousand years before these States, and many times 
ten thousand years before these States,
Garner'd clusters of ages that men and women like us grew up and 
travel'd their course and pass'd on,
What vastbuilt cities, what orderly republics, what pastoral tribes 
and nomads,
What histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others,
What laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions,
What sort of marriage, what costumes, what physiology and 
phrenology,
What of liberty and slavery among them, what they thought of 
death and the soul,
Who were witty and wise, who beautiful and poetic, who brutish 
and undevelop'd,
Not a mark, not a record remains—and yet all remains.

O I know that those men and women were not for nothing, any 
more than we are for nothing,


                                      



I know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as 
much as we now belong to it.

Afar they stand, yet near to me they stand,
Some with oval countenances learn'd and calm,
Some naked and savage, some like huge collections of insects,
Some in tents, herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,
Some prowling through woods, some living peaceably on farms,
laboring, reaping, filling barns,
Some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories,
libraries, shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments.

Are those billions of men really gone?
Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone?
Do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?
Did they achieve nothing for good for themselves?

I believe of all those men and women that fill'd the unnamed 
lands, every one exists this hour here or elsewhere, invisible 
to us,
In exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and out 
of what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinn'd, in life.

I believe that was not the end of those nations or any person of 
them, any more than this shall be the end of my nation, or 
of me;
Of their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products,
games, wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets,
I suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen world,
counterparts of what accrued to them in the seen world,
I suspect I shall meet them there,
I suspect I shall there find each old particular of those unnamed 
lands.


SONG OF PRUDENCE.

MANHATTAN'S streets I saunter'd pondering,
On Time, Space, Reality—on such as these, and abreast with 
them Prudence.

The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence,
Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that 
suits immortality.

The soul is of itself,
All verges to it, all has reference to what ensues,


                                      



All that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence,
Not a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in 
a day, month, any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour 
of death,
But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the 
indirect lifetime.

The indirect is just as much as the direct,
The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the 
body, if not more.

Not one word or deed, not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy 
of the onanist,
Putridity of gluttons or rumdrinkers, peculation, cunning, betrayal,
murder, seduction, prostitution,
But has results beyond death as really as before death.

Charity and personal force are the only investments worth any 
thing.

No specification is necessary, all that a male or female does, that is 
vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or her,
In the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole 
scope of it forever.

Who has been wise receives interest,
Savage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat,
young, old, it is the same,
The interest will come round—all will come round.

Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect,
all of the past and all of the present and all of the future,
All the brave actions of war and peace,
All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful, young 
children, widows, the sick, and to shunn'd persons,
All selfdenial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw 
others fill the seats of the boats,
All offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a 
friend's sake, or opinion's sake,
All pains of enthusiasts scoff'd at by their neighbors,
All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,
All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,
All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we 
inherit,
All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by 
name, date, location,


                                      



All that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no,
All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his 
mouth, or the shaping of his great hands,
All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe,
or on any of the wandering stars, or on any of the fix'd 
stars, by those there as we are here,
All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you 
are, or by any one,
These inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities from which 
they sprang, or shall spring.

Did you guess any thing lived only its moment?
The world does not so exist, no parts palpable or impalpable so 
exist,
No consummation exists without being from some long previous 
consummation, and that from some other,
Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the 
beginning than any.

Whatever satisfies souls is true;
Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls,
Itself only finally satisfies the soul,
The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson 
but its own.

Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with 
time, space, reality,
That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.

What is prudence is indivisible,
Declines to separate one part of life from every part,
Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from 
the dead,
Matches every thought or act by its correlative,
Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement,
Knows that the young man who composedly peril'd his life and 
lost it has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt,
That he who never peril'd his life, but retains it to old age in 
riches and ease, has probably achiev'd nothing for himself 
worth mentioning,
Knows that only that person has really learn'd who has learn'd to 
prefer results,
Who favors body and soul the same,
Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,
Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor 
avoids death.



                                      




THE SINGER IN THE PRISON.



     O sight of pity, shame and dole!
     O fearful thought—a convict soul.

RANG the refrain along the hall, the prison,
Rose to the roof, the vaults of heaven above,
Pouring in floods of melody in tones so pensive sweet and strong 
the like whereof was never heard,
Reaching the faroff sentry and the armed guards, who ceas'd their 
pacing,
Making the hearer's pulses stop for ecstasy and awe.




The sun was low in the west one winter day,
When down a narrow aisle amid the thieves and outlaws of the 
land,
(There by the hundreds seated, searfaced murderers, wily counter
feiters,
Gather'd to Sunday church in prison walls, the keepers round,
Plenteous, wellarmed, watching with vigilant eyes,)
Calmly a lady walk'd holding a little innocent child by either 
hand,
Whom seating on their stools beside her on the platform,
She, first preluding with the instrument a low and musical prelude,
In voice surpassing all, sang forth a quaint old hymn.

   A soul confined by bars and bands,
   Cries, help! O help! and wrings her hands,
   Blinded her eyes, bleeding her breast,
   Nor pardon finds, nor balm of rest.

   Ceaseless she paces to and fro,
   O heartsick days! O nights of woe!
   Nor hand of friend, nor loving face,
   Nor favor comes, nor word of grace.

   It was not I that sinn'd the sin,
   The ruthless body dragg'd me in;
   Though long I strove courageously,
   The body was too much for me.

   Dear prison'd soul bear up a space,
   For soon or late the certain grace;


                                      



     To set thee free and bear thee home,
     The heavenly pardoner death shall come.

     Convict no more, nor shame, nor dole!
     Depart—a Godenfranchis'd soul!




The singer ceas'd,
One glance swept from her clear calm eyes o'er all those upturn'd 
faces,
Strange sea of prison faces, a thousand varied, crafty, brutal, 
seam'd and beauteous faces,
Then rising, passing back along the narrow aisle between them,
While her gown touch'd them rustling in the silence,
She vanish'd with her children in the dusk.

While upon all, convicts and armed keepers ere they stirr'd,
(Convict forgetting prison, keeper his loaded pistol,)
A hush and pause fell down a wondrous minute,
With deep halfstifled sobs and sound of bad men bow'd and 
moved to weeping,
And youth's convulsive breathings, memories of home,
The mother's voice in lullaby, the sister's care, the happy childhood,
The longpent spirit rous'd to reminiscence;
A wondrous minute then—but after in the solitary night, to many, 
many there,
Years after, even in the hour of death, the sad refrain, the tune, 
the voice, the words,
Resumed, the large calm lady walks the narrow aisle,
The wailing melody again, the singer in the prison sings,

O sight of pity, shame and dole!
O fearful thought—a convict soul.



WARBLE FOR LILACTIME.

WARBLE me now for joy of lilactime, (returning in reminiscence,)
Sort me O tongue and lips for Nature's sake, souvenirs of earliest 
summer,
Gather the welcome signs, (as children with pebbles or stringing 
shells,)
Put in April and May, the hylas croaking in the ponds, the elastic 
air,
Bees, butterflies, the sparrow with its simple notes,


                                      



Bluebird and darting swallow, nor forget the highhole flashing 
his golden wings,
The tranquil sunny haze, the clinging smoke, the vapor,
Shimmer of waters with fish in them, the cerulean above,
All that is jocund and sparkling, the brooks running,
The maple woods, the crisp February days and the sugarmaking,
The robin where he hops, brighteyed, brownbreasted,
With musical clear call at sunrise, and again at sunset,
Or flitting among the trees of the appleorchard, building the nest 
of his mate,
The melted snow of March, the willow sending forth its yellow
green sprouts,
For springtime is here! the summer is here! and what is this 
in it and from it?
Thou, soul, unloosen'd—the restlessness after I know not what;
Come, let us lag here no longer, let us be up and away!
O if one could but fly like a bird!
O to escape, to sail forth as in a ship!
To glide with thee O soul, o'er all, in all, as a ship o'er the waters;
Gathering these hints, the preludes, the blue sky, the grass, the 
morning drops of dew,
The lilacscent, the bushes with dark green heartshaped leaves,
Woodviolets, the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence,
Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their atmos
phere,
To grace the bush I love—to sing with the birds,
A warble for joy of lilactime, returning in reminiscence.


OUTLINES FOR A TOMB.
(G. P., Buried .)



WHAT may we chant, O thou within this tomb?
What tablets, outlines, hang for thee, O millionnaire?
The life thou lived'st we know not,
But that thou walk'dst thy years in barter, 'mid the haunts of 
brokers,
Nor heroism thine, nor war, nor glory.




Silent, my soul,
With drooping lids, as waiting, ponder'd,
Turning from all the samples, monuments of heroes.



                                      



While through the interior vistas,
Noiseless uprose, phantasmic, (as by night Auroras of the north,)
Lambent tableaus, prophetic, bodiless scenes,
Spiritual projections.

In one, among the city streets a laborer's home appear'd,
After his day's work done, cleanly, sweetair'd, the gaslight burning,
The carpet swept and a fire in the cheerful stove.

In one, the sacred parturition scene,
A happy painless mother birth'd a perfect child.

In one, at a bounteous morning meal,
Sat peaceful parents with contented sons.

In one, by twos and threes, young people,
Hundreds concentring, walk'd the paths and streets and roads,
Toward a talldomed school.

In one a trio beautiful,
Grandmother, loving daughter, loving daughter's daughter, sat,
Chatting and sewing.

In one, along a suite of noble rooms,
'Mid plenteous books and journals, paintings on the walls, fine 
statuettes,
Were groups of friendly journeymen, mechanics young and old,
Reading, conversing.

All, all the shows of laboring life,
City and country, women's, men's and children's,
Their wants provided for, hued in the sun and tinged for once 
with joy,
Marriage, the street, the factory, farm, the houseroom, lodging
room,
Labor and toil, the bath, gymnasium, playground, library, college,
The student, boy or girl, led forward to be taught,
The sick cared for, the shoeless shod, the orphan father'd and 
mother'd,
The hungry fed, the houseless housed;
(The intentions perfect and divine,
The workings, details, haply human.)




O thou within this tomb,
From thee such scenes, thou stintless, lavish giver,


                                      



Tallying the gifts of earth, large as the earth,
Thy name an earth, with mountains, fields and tides.

Nor by your streams alone, you rivers,
By you, your banks Connecticut,
By you and all your teeming life old Thames,
By you Potomac laving the ground Washington trod, by you 
Patapsco,
You Hudson, you endless Mississippi—nor you alone,
But to the high seas launch, my thought, his memory.



OUT FROM BEHIND THIS MASK.
(To Confront a Portrait.)



OUT from behind this bending roughcut mask,
These lights and shades, this drama of the whole,
This common curtain of the face contain'd in me for me, in you 
for you, in each for each,
(Tragedies, sorrows, laughter, tears—O heaven!
The passionate teeming plays this curtain hid!)
This glaze of God's serenest purest sky,
This film of Satan's seething pit,
This heart's geography's map, this limitless small continent, this 
soundless sea;
Out from the convolutions of this globe,
This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon, than Jupiter, Venus, 
Mars,
This condensation of the universe, (nay here the only universe,
Here the idea, all in this mystic handful wrapt;)
These burin'd eyes, flashing to you to pass to future time,
To launch and spin through space revolving sideling, from these 
to emanate,
To you whoe'er you are—a look.




A traveler of thoughts and years, of peace and war,
Of youth long sped and middle age declining,
(As the first volume of a tale perused and laid away, and this the 
second,
Songs, ventures, speculations, presently to close,)
Lingering a moment here and now, to you I opposite turn,


                                      



As on the road or at some crevice door by chance, or open'd win
dow,
Pausing, inclining, baring my head, you specially I greet,
To draw and clinch your soul for once inseparably with mine,
Then travel travel on.



VOCALISM.



VOCALISM, measure, concentration, determination, and the divine 
power to speak words;
Are you fulllung'd and limberlipp'd from long trial? from vigor
ous practice? from physique?
Do you move in these broad lands as broad as they?
Come duly to the divine power to speak words?
For only at last after many years, after chastity, friendship, procrea
tion, prudence, and nakedness,
After treading ground and breasting river and lake,
After a loosen'd throat, after absorbing eras, temperaments, races, 
after knowledge, freedom, crimes,
After complete faith, after clarifyings, elevations, and removing 
obstructions,
After these and more, it is just possible there comes to a man, a 
woman, the divine power to speak words;
Then toward that man or that woman swiftly hasten all—none 
refuse, all attend,
Armies, ships, antiquities, libraries, paintings, machines, cities, 
hate, despair, amity, pain, theft, murder, aspiration, form in 
close ranks,
They debouch as they are wanted to march obediently through 
the mouth of that man or that woman.




O what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices?
Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her I shall 
follow,
As the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps, anywhere 
around the globe.

All waits for the right voices;
Where is the practis'd and perfect organ? where is the develop'd 
soul?
For I see every word utter'd thence has deeper, sweeter, new 
sounds, impossible on less terms.



                                      



I see brains and lips closed, tympans and temples unstruck,
Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose,
Until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies 
slumbering forever ready in all words.



TO HIM THAT WAS CRUCIFIED.

MY spirit to yours dear brother,
Do not mind because many sounding your name do not under
stand you,
I do not sound your name, but I understand you,
I specify you with joy O my comrade to salute you, and to salute 
those who are with you, before and since, and those to 
come also,
That we all labor together transmitting the same charge and suc
cession,
We few equals indifferent of lands, indifferent of times,
We, enclosers of all continents, all castes, allowers of all theologies,
Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,
We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the 
disputers nor any thing that is asserted,
We hear the bawling and din, we are reach'd at by divisions, jeal
ousies, recriminations on every side,
They close peremptorily upon us to surround us, my comrade,
Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, journeying up and 
down till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the 
diverse eras,
Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and women of races,
ages to come, may prove brethren and lovers as we are.


YOU FELONS ON TRIAL IN COURTS.

YOU felons on trial in courts,
You convicts in prisoncells, you sentenced assassins chain'd and 
handcuff'd with iron,
Who am I too that I am not on trial or in prison?
Me ruthless and devilish as any, that my wrists are not chain'd 
with iron, or my ankles with iron?

You prostitutes flaunting over the trottoirs or obscene in your 
rooms,
Who am I that I should call you more obscene than myself?



                                      



O culpable! I acknowledge—I exposé!
(O admirers, praise not me—compliment not me—you make 
me wince,
I see what you do not—I know what you do not.)

Inside these breastbones I lie smutch'd and choked,
Beneath this face that appears so impassive hell's tides continually 
run,
Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me,
I walk with delinquents with passionate love,
I feel I am of them—I belong to those convicts and prostitutes 
myself,
And henceforth I will not deny them—for how can I deny myself?


LAWS FOR CREATIONS.

LAWS for creations,
For strong artists and leaders, for fresh broods of teachers and 
perfect literats for America,
For noble savans and coming musicians.

All must have reference to the ensemble of the world, and the 
compact truth of the world,
There shall be no subject too pronounced—all works shall illus
trate the divine law of indirections.

What do you suppose creation is?
What do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to walk free and 
own no superior?
What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways,
but that man or woman is as good as God?
And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself?
And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean?
And that you or any one must approach creations through such 
laws?


TO A COMMON PROSTITUTE.

BE composed—be at ease with me—I am Walt Whitman, liberal 
and lusty as Nature,
Not till the sun excludes you do I exclude you,
Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to rustle 
for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you.



                                      



My girl I appoint with you an appointment, and I charge you that 
you make preparation to be worthy to meet me,
And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come.

Till then I salute you with a significant look that you do not forget 
me.


I WAS LOOKING A LONG WHILE.

I WAS looking a long while for Intentions,
For a clew to the history of the past for myself, and for these 
chants—and now I have found it,
It is not in those paged fables in the libraries, (them I neither 
accept nor reject,)
It is no more in the legends than in all else,
It is in the present—it is this earth today,
It is in Democracy—(the purport and aim of all the past,)
It is the life of one man or one woman today—the average man 
of today,
It is in languages, social customs, literatures, arts,
It is in the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery, poli
tics, creeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of 
nations,
All for the modern—all for the average man of today.


THOUGHT.

OF persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies, wealth, scholar
ships, and the like;
(To me all that those persons have arrived at sinks away from 
them, except as it results to their bodies and souls,
So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked,
And often to me each one mocks the others, and mocks himself or 
herself,
And of each one the core of life, namely happiness, is full of the 
rotten excrement of maggots,
And often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true 
realities of life, and go toward false realities,
And often to me they are alive after what custom has served them,
but nothing more,
And often to me they are sad, hasty, unwaked sonnambules walk
ing the dusk.)



                                      




MIRACLES.

WHY, who makes much of a miracle?
As to me I know of nothing else but miracles,
Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan,
Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,
Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the 
water,
Or stand under trees in the woods,
Or talk by day with any one I love, or sleep in the bed at night 
with any one I love,
Or sit at table at dinner with the rest,
Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,
Or watch honeybees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon,
Or animals feeding in the fields,
Or birds, or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,
Or the wonderfulness of the sundown, or of stars shining so quiet 
and bright,
Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring;
These with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,
The whole referring, yet each distinct and in its place.

To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,
Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,
Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the 
same,
Every foot of the interior swarms with the same.

To me the sea is a continual miracle,
The fishes that swim—the rocks—the motion of the waves—
the ships with men in them,
What stranger miracles are there?


SPARKLES FROM THE WHEEL.

WHERE the city's ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day,
Withdrawn I join a group of children watching, I pause aside with 
them.

By the curb toward the edge of the flagging,
A knifegrinder works at his wheel sharpening a great knife,
Bending over he carefully holds it to the stone, by foot and knee,
With measur'd tread he turns rapidly, as he presses with light but 
firm hand,


                                      



Forth issue then in copious golden jets,
Sparkles from the wheel.

The scene and all its belongings, how they seize and affect me,
The sad sharpchinn'd old man with worn clothes and broad 
shoulderband of leather,
Myself effusing and fluid, a phantom curiously floating, now here 
absorb'd and arrested,
The group, (an unminded point set in a vast surrounding,)
The attentive, quiet children, the loud, proud, restive base of the 
streets,
The low hoarse purr of the whirling stone, the lightpress'd blade,
Diffusing, dropping, sidewaysdarting, in tiny showers of gold,
Sparkles from the wheel.


TO A PUPIL.

IS reform needed? is it through you?
The greater the reform needed, the greater the Personality you 
need to accomplish it.

You! do you not see how it would serve to have eyes, blood,
complexion, clean and sweet?
Do you not see how it would serve to have such a body and soul 
that when you enter the crowd an atmosphere of desire 
and command enters with you, and every one is impress'd 
with your Personality?

O the magnet! the flesh over and over!
Go, dear friend, if need be give up all else, and commence today 
to inure yourself to pluck, reality, selfesteem, definiteness,
elevatedness,
Rest not till you rivet and publish yourself of your own Personality.


UNFOLDED OUT OF THE FOLDS.

UNFOLDED out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded,
and is always to come unfolded,
Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth is to come 
the superbest man of the earth,
Unfolded out of the friendliest woman is to come the friendliest 
man,
Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman can a man be 
form'd of perfect body,


                                      



Unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of woman can come 
the poems of man, (only thence have my poems come;)
Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I love, only 
thence can appear the strong and arrogant man I love,
Unfolded by brawny embraces from the wellmuscled woman I 
love, only thence come the brawny embraces of the man,
Unfolded out of the folds of the woman's brain come all the folds 
of the man's brain, duly obedient,
Unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded,
Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy;
A man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity, but 
every jot of the greatness of man is unfolded out of 
woman;
First the man is shaped in the woman, he can then be shaped in 
himself.


WHAT AM I AFTER ALL.

WHAT am I after all but a child, pleas'd with the sound of my own 
name? repeating it over and over;
I stand apart to hear—it never tires me.

To you your name also;
Did you think there was nothing but two or three pronunciations 
in the sound of your name?


KOSMOS.

WHO includes diversity and is Nature,
Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sex
uality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth, and 
the equilibrium also,
Who has not look'd forth from the windows the eyes for nothing,
or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,
Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic 
lover,
Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism,
and of the aesthetic or intellectual,
Who having consider'd the body finds all its organs and parts 
good,
Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body under
stands by subtle analogies all other theories,
The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these 
States;


                                      



Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in 
other globes with their suns and moons,
Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day 
but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,
The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable to
gether.


OTHERS MAY PRAISE WHAT THEY LIKE.

OTHERS may praise what they like;
But I, from the banks of the running Missouri, praise nothing in 
art or aught else,
Till it has well inhaled the atmosphere of this river, also the 
western prairiescent,
And exudes it all again.


WHO LEARNS MY LESSON COMPLETE?

WHO learns my lesson complete?
Boss, journeyman, apprentice, churchman and atheist,
The stupid and the wise thinker, parents and offspring, merchant,
clerk, porter and customer,
Editor, author, artist, and schoolboy—draw nigh and commence;
It is no lesson—it lets down the bars to a good lesson,
And that to another, and every one to another still.

The great laws take and effuse without argument,
I am of the same style, for I am their friend,
I love them quits and quits, I do not halt and make salaams.

I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons 
of things,
They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.

I cannot say to any person what I hear—I cannot say it to myself 
—it is very wonderful.

It is no small matter, this round and delicious globe moving so 
exactly in its orbit for ever and ever, without one jolt or the 
untruth of a single second,
I do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years,
nor ten billions of years,
Nor plann'd and built one thing after another as an architect 
plans and builds a house.



                                      



I do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman,
Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman,
Nor that years will ever stop the existence of me, or any one else.

Is it wonderful that I should be immortal? as every one is im
mortal;
I know it is wonderful, but my eyesight is equally wonderful, and 
how I was conceived in my mother's womb is equally 
wonderful,
And pass'd from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of 
summers and winters to articulate and walk—all this is 
equally wonderful.

And that my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each 
other without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to 
see each other, is every bit as wonderful.

And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful,
And that I can remind you, and you think them and know them 
to be true, is just as wonderful.

And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth, is 
equally wonderful,
And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally 
wonderful.


TESTS.

ALL submit to them where they sit, inner, secure, unapproachable 
to analysis in the soul,
Not traditions, not the outer authorities are the judges,
They are the judges of outer authorities and of all traditions,
They corroborate as they go only whatever corroborates them
selves, and touches themselves;
For all that, they have it forever in themselves to corroborate far 
and near without one exception.


THE TORCH.

ON my Northwest coast in the midst of the night a fishermen's 
group stands watching,
Out on the lake that expands before them, others are spearing 
salmon,
The canoe, a dim shadowy thing, moves across the black water,
Bearing a torch ablaze at the prow.



                                      




O STAR OF FRANCE.
.

O STAR of France,
The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame,
Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long,
Beseems today a wreck driven by the gale, a mastless hulk,
And 'mid its teeming madden'd halfdrown'd crowds,
Nor helm nor helmsman.

Dim smitten star,
Orb not of France alone, pale symbol of my soul, its dearest 
hopes,
The struggle and the daring, rage divine for liberty,
Of aspirations toward the far ideal, enthusiast's dreams of brother
hood,
Of terror to the tyrant and the priest.

Star crucified—by traitors sold,
Star panting o'er a land of death, heroic land,
Strange, passionate, mocking, frivolous land.

Miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, I will not now rebuke 
thee,
Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell'd them all,
And left thee sacred.

In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly,
In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself however great the price,
In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg'd sleep,
In that alone among thy sisters thou, giantess, didst rend the ones 
that shamed thee,
In that thou couldst not, wouldst not, wear the usual chains,
This cross, thy livid face, thy pierced hands and feet,
The spear thrust in thy side.

O star! O ship of France, beat back and baffled long!
Bear up O smitten orb! O ship continue on!

Sure as the ship of all, the Earth itself,
Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos,
Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons,
Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty,
Onward beneath the sun following its course,
So thee O ship of France!



                                      



Finish'd the days, the clouds dispel'd,
The travail o'er, the longsought extrication,
When lo! reborn, high o'er the European world,
(In gladness answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours 
Columbia,)
Again thy star O France, fair lustrous star,
In heavenly peace, clearer, more bright than ever,
Shall beam immortal.


THE OXTAMER.

IN a faraway northern county in the placid pastoral region,
Lives my farmer friend, the theme of my recitative, a famous 
tamer of oxen,
There they bring him the threeyearolds and the fouryearolds to 
break them,
He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and 
tame him,
He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock 
chafes up and down the yard,
The bullock's head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes,
Yet see you! how soon his rage subsides—how soon this tamer 
tames him;
See you! on the farms hereabout a hundred oxen young and old,
and he is the man who has tamed them,
They all know him, all are affectionate to him;
See you! some are such beautiful animals, so lofty looking;
Some are buffcolor'd, some mottled, one has a white line running 
along his back, some are brindled,
Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)—see you! the 
bright hides,
See, the two with stars on their foreheads—see, the round bodies 
and broad backs,
How straight and square they stand on their legs—what fine 
sagacious eyes!
How they watch their tamer—they wish him near them—how 
they turn to look after him!
What yearning expression! how uneasy they are when he moves 
away from them;
Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics,
poems, depart—all else departs,)
I confess I envy only his fascination—my silent, illiterate friend,
Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms,
In the northern county far, in the placid pastoral region.



                                      




AN OLD MAN'S THOUGHT OF SCHOOL.
For the Inauguration of a Public School, Camden, New Jersey, .

AN old man's thought of school,
An old man gathering youthful memories and blooms that youth 
itself cannot.

Now only do I know you,
O fair auroral skies—O morning dew upon the grass!

And these I see, these sparkling eyes,
These stores of mystic meaning, these young lives,
Building, equipping like a fleet of ships, immortal ships,
Soon to sail out over the measureless seas,
On the soul's voyage.

Only a lot of boys and girls?
Only the tiresome spelling, writing, ciphering classes?
Only a public school?

Ah more, infinitely more;
(As George Fox rais'd his warning cry, "Is it this pile of brick 
and mortar, these dead floors, windows, rails, you call the 
church?
Why this is not the church at all—the church is living, ever living 
souls.")

And you America,
Cast you the real reckoning for your present?
The lights and shadows of your future, good or evil?
To girlhood, boyhood look, the teacher and the school.


WANDERING AT MORN.

WANDERING at morn,
Emerging from the night from gloomy thoughts, thee in my 
thoughts,
Yearning for thee harmonious Union! thee, singing bird divine!
Thee coil'd in evil times my country, with craft and black dismay,
with every meanness, treason thrust upon thee,
This common marvel I beheld—the parent thrush I watch'd feed
ing its young,
The singing thrush whose tones of joy and faith ecstatic,
Fail not to certify and cheer my soul.



                                      



There ponder'd, felt I,
If worms, snakes, loathsome grubs, may to sweet spiritual songs 
be turn'd,
If vermin so transposed, so used and bless'd may be,
Then may I trust in you, your fortunes, days, my country;
Who knows but these may be the lessons fit for you?
From these your future song may rise with joyous trills,
Destin'd to fill the world.


ITALIAN MUSIC IN DAKOTA.
"The Seventeenth—the finest Regimental Band I ever heard."

THROUGH the soft evening air enwinding all,
Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless wilds,
In dulcet streams, in flutes' and cornets' notes,
Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial,
(Yet strangely fitting even here, meanings unknown before,
Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, related here,
Not to the city's fresco'd rooms, not to the audience of the opera 
house,
Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at home,
Sonnambula's innocent love, trios with Norma's anguish,
And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto;)
Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,
Music, Italian music in Dakota.

While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm,
Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,
Acknowledging rapport however far remov'd,
(As some old root or soil of earth its lastborn flower or fruit,)
Listens well pleas'd.


WITH ALL THY GIFTS.

WITH all thy gifts America,
Standing secure, rapidly tending, overlooking the world,
Power, wealth, extent, vouchsafed to thee—with these and like 
of these vouchsafed to thee,
What if one gift thou lackest? (the ultimate human problem never 
solving,)
The gift of perfect women fit for thee—what if that gift of gifts 
thou lackest?
The towering feminine of thee? the beauty, health, completion,
fit for thee?
The mothers fit for thee?



                                      




MY PICTUREGALLERY.

IN a little house keep I pictures suspended, it is not a fix'd house,
It is round, it is only a few inches from one side to the other;
Yet behold, it has room for all the shows of the world, all memo
ries!
Here the tableaus of life, and here the groupings of death;
Here, do you know this? this is cicerone himself,
With finger rais'd he points to the prodigal pictures.


THE PRAIRIE STATES.

A NEWER garden of creation, no primal solitude,
Dense, joyous, modern, populous millions, cities and farms,
With iron interlaced, composite, tied, many in one,
By all the world contributed—freedom's and law's and thrift's 
society,
The crown and teeming paradise, so far, of time's accumulations,
To justify the past.

PROUD MUSIC OF THE STORM.



PROUD music of the storm,
Blast that careers so free, whistling across the prairies,
Strong hum of forest treetops—wind of the mountains,
Personified dim shapes—you hidden orchestras,
You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert,
Blending with Nature's rhythmus all the tongues of nations;
You chords left as by vast composers—you choruses,
You formless, free, religious dances—you from the Orient,
You undertone of rivers, roar of pouring cataracts,
You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry,
Echoes of camps with all the different buglecalls,
Trooping tumultuous, filling the midnight late, bending me power
less,
Entering my lonesome slumberchamber, why have you seiz'd me?




Come forward O my soul, and let the rest retire,
Listen, lose not, it is toward thee they tend,
Parting the midnight, entering my slumberchamber,
For thee they sing and dance O soul.



                                      



A festival song,
The duet of the bridegroom and the bride, a marriagemarch,
With lips of love, and hearts of lovers fill'd to the brim with love,
The redflush'd cheeks and perfumes, the cortege swarming full of 
friendly faces young and old,
To flutes' clear notes and sounding harps' cantabile.

Now loud approaching drums,
Victoria! see'st thou in powdersmoke the banners torn but flying?
the rout of the baffled?
Hearest those shouts of a conquering army?

(Ah soul, the sobs of women, the wounded groaning in agony,
The hiss and crackle of flames, the blacken'd ruins, the embers 
of cities,
The dirge and desolation of mankind.)

Now airs antique and mediaeval fill me,
I see and hear old harpers with their harps at Welsh festivals,
I hear the minnesingers singing their lays of love,
I hear the minstrels, gleemen, troubadours, of the middle ages.

Now the great organ sounds,
Tremulous, while underneath, (as the hid footholds of the earth,
On which arising rest, and leaping forth depend,
All shapes of beauty, grace and strength, all hues we know,
Green blades of grass and warbling birds, children that gambol 
and play, the clouds of heaven above,)
The strong base stands, and its pulsations intermits not,
Bathing, supporting, merging all the rest, maternity of all the 
rest,
And with it every instrument in multitudes,
The players playing, all the world's musicians,
The solemn hymns and masses rousing adoration,
All passionate heartchants, sorrowful appeals,
The measureless sweet vocalists of ages,
And for their solvent setting earth's own diapason,
Of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves,
A new composite orchestra, binder of years and climes, tenfold 
renewer,
As of the farback days the poets tell, the Paradiso,
The straying thence, the separation long, but now the wandering 
done,
The journey done, the journeyman come home,
And man and art with Nature fused again.



                                      



Tutti! for earth and heaven;
(The Almighty leader now for once has signal'd with his wand.)

The manly strophe of the husbands of the world,
And all the wives responding.

The tongues of violins,
(I think O tongues ye tell this heart, that cannot tell itself,
This brooding yearning heart, that cannot tell itself.)




Ah from a little child,
Thou knowest soul how to me all sounds became music,
My mother's voice in lullaby or hymn,
(The voice, O tender voices, memory's loving voices,
Last miracle of all, O dearest mother's, sister's, voices;)
The rain, the growing corn, the breeze among the longleav'd corn,
The measur'd seasurf beating on the sand,
The twittering bird, the hawk's sharp scream,
The wildfowl's notes at night as flying low migrating north or 
south,
The psalm in the country church or mid the clustering trees, the 
open air campmeeting,
The fiddler in the tavern, the glee, the longstrung sailorsong,
The lowing cattle, bleating sheep, the crowing cock at dawn.

All songs of current lands come sounding round me,
The German airs of friendship, wine and love,
Irish ballads, merry jigs and dances, English warbles,
Chansons of France, Scotch tunes, and o'er the rest,
Italia's peerless compositions.

Across the stage with pallor on her face, yet lurid passion,
Stalks Norma brandishing the dagger in her hand.

I see poor crazed Lucia's eyes' unnatural gleam,
Her hair down her back falls loose and dishevel'd.

I see where Ernani walking the bridal garden,
Amid the scent of nightroses, radiant, holding his bride by the 
hand,
Hears the infernal call, the deathpledge of the horn.

To crossing swords and gray hairs bared to heaven,
The clear electric base and baritone of the world,
The trombone duo, Libertad forever!



                                      



From Spanish chestnut trees' dense shade,
By old and heavy convent walls a wailing song,
Song of lost love, the torch of youth and life quench'd in despair,
Song of the dying swan, Fernando's heart is breaking.

Awaking from her woes at last retriev'd Amina sings,
Copious as stars and glad as morning light the torrents of her joy.

(The teeming lady comes,
The lustrious orb, Venus contralto, the blooming mother,
Sister of loftiest gods, Alboni's self I hear.)




I hear those odes, symphonies, operas,
I hear in the William Tell the music of an arous'd and angry 
people,
I hear Meyerbeer's Huguenots, the Prophet, or Robert,
Gounod's Faust, or Mozart's Don Juan.

I hear the dancemusic of all nations,
The waltz, some delicious measure, lapsing, bathing me in bliss,
The bolero to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets.

I see religious dances old and new,
I hear the sound of the Hebrew lyre,
I see the crusaders marching bearing the cross on high, to the 
martial clang of cymbals,
I hear dervishes monotonously chanting, interspers'd with frantic 
shouts, as they spin around turning always towards Mecca,
I see the rapt religious dances of the Persians and the Arabs,
Again, at Eleusis, home of Ceres, I see the modern Greeks dancing,
I hear them clapping their hands as they bend their bodies,
I hear the metrical shuffling of their feet.

I see again the wild old Corybantian dance, the performers 
wounding each other,
I see the Roman youth to the shrill sound of flageolets throwing 
and catching their weapons,
As they fall on their knees and rise again.

I hear from the Mussulman mosque the muezzin calling,
I see the worshippers within, nor form nor sermon, argument nor 
word,
But silent, strange, devout, rais'd, glowing heads, ecstatic faces.



                                      



I hear the Egyptian harp of many strings,
The primitive chants of the Nile boatmen,
The sacred imperial hymns of China,
To the delicate sounds of the king, (the stricken wood and stone,)
Or to Hindu flutes and the fretting twang of the vina,
A band of bayaderes.




Now Asia, Africa leave me, Europe seizing inflates me,
To organs huge and bands I hear as from vast concourses of 
voices,
Luther's strong hymn, Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott,
Rossini's Stabat Mater dolorosa,
Or floating in some high cathedral dim with gorgeous color'd 
windows,
The passionate Agnus Dei or Gloria in Excelsis.

Composers! mighty maestros!
And you, sweet singers of old lands, soprani, tenori, bassi!
To you a new bard caroling in the West,
Obeisant sends his love.

(Such led to thee O soul,
All senses, shows and objects, lead to thee,
But now it seems to me sound leads o'er all the rest.)

I hear the annual singing of the children in St. Paul's cathedral,
Or, under the high roof of some colossal hall, the symphonies,
oratorios of Beethoven, Handel, or Haydn,
The Creation in billows of godhood laves me.

Give me to hold all sounds, (I madly struggling cry,)
Fill me with all the voices of the universe,
Endow me with their throbbings, Nature's also,
The tempests, waters, winds, operas and chants, marches and 
dances,
Utter, pour in, for I would take them all!




Then I woke softly,
And pausing, questioning awhile the music of my dream,
And questioning all those reminiscences, the tempest in its fury,
And all the songs of sopranos and tenors,
And those rapt oriental dances of religious fervor,


                                      



And the sweet varied instruments, and the diapason of organs,
And all the artless plaints of love and grief and death,
I said to my silent curious soul out of the bed of the slumber
chamber,
Come, for I have found the clew I sought so long,
Let us go forth refresh'd amid the day,
Cheerfully tallying life, walking the world, the real,
Nourish'd henceforth by our celestial dream.

And I said, moreover,
Haply what thou hast heard O soul was not the sound of winds,
Nor dream of raging storm, nor seahawk's flapping wings nor 
harsh scream,
Nor vocalism of sunbright Italy,
Nor German organ majestic, nor vast concourse of voices, nor 
layers of harmonies,
Nor strophes of husbands and wives, nor sound of marching 
soldiers,
Nor flutes, nor harps, nor the buglecalls of camps,
But to a new rhythmus fitted for thee,
Poems bridging the way from Life to Death, vaguely wafted in 
night air, uncaught, unwritten,
Which let us go forth in the bold day and write.



PASSAGE TO INDIA.



SINGING my days,
Singing the great achievements of the present,
Singing the strong light works of engineers,
Our modern wonders, (the antique ponderous Seven outvied,)
In the Old World the east the Suez canal,
The New by its mighty railroad spann'd,
The seas inlaid with eloquent gentle wires;
Yet first to sound, and ever sound, the cry with thee O soul,
The Past! the Past! the Past!

The Past—the dark unfathom'd retrospect!
The teeming gulf—the sleepers and the shadows!
The past—the infinite greatness of the past!
For what is the present after all but a growth out of the past?


                                      



(As a projectile form'd, impell'd, passing a certain line, still keeps 
on,
So the present, utterly form'd, impell'd by the past.)




Passage O soul to India!
Eclaircise the myths Asiatic, the primitive fables.

Not you alone proud truths of the world,
Nor you alone ye facts of modern science,
But myths and fables of eld, Asia's, Africa's fables,
The fardarting beams of the spirit, the unloos'd dreams,
The deep diving bibles and legends,
The daring plots of the poets, the elder religions;
O you temples fairer than lilies pour'd over by the rising sun!
O you fables spurning the known, eluding the hold of the known,
mounting to heaven!
You lofty and dazzling towers, pinnacled, red as roses, burnish'd 
with gold!
Towers of fables immortal fashion'd from mortal dreams!
You too I welcome and fully the same as the rest!
You too with joy I sing.

Passage to India!
Lo, soul, seest thou not God's purpose from the first?
The earth to be spann'd, connected by network,
The races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage,
The oceans to be cross'd, the distant brought near,
The lands to be welded together.

A worship new I sing,
You captains, voyagers, explorers, yours,
You engineers, you architects, machinists, yours,
You, not for trade or transportation only,
But in God's name, and for thy sake O soul.




Passage to India!
Lo soul for thee of tableaus twain,
I see in one the Suez canal initiated, open'd,
I see the procession of steamships, the Empress Eugenie's leading 
the van,
I mark from on deck the strange landscape, the pure sky, the 
level sand in the distance,
I pass swiftly the picturesque groups, the workmen gather'd,
The gigantic dredging machines.



                                      



In one again, different, (yet thine, all thine, O soul, the same,)
I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting 
every barrier,
I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying 
freight and passengers,
I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring, and the shrill steam
whistle,
I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the 
world,
I cross the Laramie plains, I note the rocks in grotesque shapes,
the buttes,
I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions, the barren, colorless,
sagedeserts,
I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the 
great mountains, I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch 
mountains,
I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle's Nest, I pass the 
Promontory, I ascend the Nevadas,
I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base,
I see the Humboldt range, I thread the valley and cross the river,
I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe, I see forests of majestic 
pines,
Or crossing the great desert, the alkaline plains, I behold enchant
ing mirages of waters and meadows,
Marking through these and after all, in duplicate slender lines,
Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel,
Tying the Eastern to the Western sea,
The road between Europe and Asia.

(Ah Genoese thy dream! thy dream!
Centuries after thou art laid in thy grave,
The shore thou foundest verifies thy dream.)




Passage to India!
Struggles of many a captain, tales of many a sailor dead,
Over my mood stealing and spreading they come,
Like clouds and cloudlets in the unreach'd sky.

Along all history, down the slopes,
As a rivulet running, sinking now, and now again to the surface 
rising,
A ceaseless thought, a varied train—lo, soul, to thee, thy sight,
they rise,
The plans, the voyages again, the expeditions;


                                      



Again Vasco de Gama sails forth,
Again the knowledge gain'd, the mariner's compass,
Lands found and nations born, thou born America,
For purpose vast, man's long probation fill'd,
Thou rondure of the world at last accomplish'd.




O vast Rondure, swimming in space,
Cover'd all over with visible power and beauty,
Alternate light and day and the teeming spiritual darkness,
Unspeakable high processions of sun and moon and countless 
stars above,
Below, the manifold grass and waters, animals, mountains, trees,
With inscrutable purpose, some hidden prophetic intention,
Now first it seems my thought begins to span thee.

Down from the gardens of Asia descending radiating,
Adam and Eve appear, then their myriad progeny after them,
Wandering, yearning, curious, with restless explorations,
With questionings, baffled, formless, feverish, with neverhappy 
hearts,
With that sad incessant refrain, Wherefore unsatisfied soul? and 
Whither O mocking life?

Ah who shall soothe these feverish children?
Who justify these restless explorations?
Who speak the secret of impassive earth?
Who bind it to us? what is this separate Nature so unnatural?
What is this earth to our affections? (unloving earth, without a 
throb to answer ours,
Cold earth, the place of graves.)

Yet soul be sure the first intent remains, and shall be carried out,
Perhaps even now the time has arrived.

After the seas are all cross'd, (as they seem already cross'd,)
After the great captains and engineers have accomplish'd their 
work,
After the noble inventors, after the scientists, the chemist, the 
geologist, ethnologist,
Finally shall come the poet worthy that name,
The true son of God shall come singing his songs.

Then not your deeds only O voyagers, O scientists and inventors,
shall be justified,


                                      



All these hearts as of fretted children shall be sooth'd,
All affection shall be fully responded to, the secret shall be told,
All these separations and gaps shall be taken up and hook'd and 
link'd together,
The whole earth, this cold, impassive, voiceless earth, shall be 
completely justified,
Trinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplish'd and compacted by 
the true son of God, the poet,
(He shall indeed pass the straits and conquer the mountains,
He shall double the cape of Good Hope to some purpose,)
Nature and Man shall be disjoin'd and diffused no more,
The true son of God shall absolutely fuse them.




Year at whose wideflung door I sing!
Year of the purpose accomplish'd!
Year of the marriage of continents, climates and oceans!
(No mere doge of Venice now wedding the Adriatic,)
I see O year in you the vast terraqueous globe given and giving 
all,
Europe to Asia, Africa join'd, and they to the New World,
The lands, geographies, dancing before you, holding a festival 
garland,
As brides and bridegrooms hand in hand.

Passage to India!
Cooling airs from Caucasus far, soothing cradle of man,
The river Euphrates flowing, the past lit up again.

Lo soul, the retrospect brought forward,
The old, most populous, wealthiest of earth's lands,
The streams of the Indus and the Ganges and their many af
fluents,
(I my shores of America walking today behold, resuming all,)
The tale of Alexander on his warlike marches suddenly dying,
On one side China and on the other side Persia and Arabia,
To the south the great seas and the bay of Bengal,
The flowing literatures, tremendous epics, religions, castes,
Old occult Brahma interminably far back, the tender and junior 
Buddha,
Central and southern empires and all their belongings, possessors,
The wars of Tamerlane, the reign of Aurungzebe,
The traders, rulers, explorers, Moslems, Venetians, Byzantium, the 
Arabs, Portuguese,


                                      



The first travelers famous yet, Marco Polo, Batouta the Moor,
Doubts to be solv'd, the map incognita, blanks to be fill'd,
The foot of man unstay'd, the hands never at rest,
Thyself O soul that will not brook a challenge.

The mediaeval navigators rise before me,
The world of , with its awaken'd enterprise,
Something swelling in humanity now like the sap of the earth in 
spring,
The sunset splendor of chivalry declining.

And who art thou sad shade?
Gigantic, visionary, thyself a visionary,
With majestic limbs and pious beaming eyes,
Spreading around with every look of thine a golden world,
Enhuing it with gorgeous hues.

As the chief histrion,
Down to the footlights walks in some great scena,
Dominating the rest I see the Admiral himself,
(History's type of courage, action, faith,)
Behold him sail from Palos leading his little fleet,
His voyage behold, his return, his great fame,
His misfortunes, calumniators, behold him a prisoner, chain'd,
Behold his dejection, poverty, death.

(Curious in time I stand, noting the efforts of heroes,
Is the deferment long? bitter the slander, poverty, death?
Lies the seed unreck'd for centuries in the ground? lo, to God's 
due occasion,
Uprising in the night, it sprouts, blooms,
And fills the earth with use and beauty.)




Passage indeed O soul to primal thought,
Not lands and seas alone, thy own clear freshness,
The young maturity of brood and bloom,
To realms of budding bibles.

O soul, repressless, I with thee and thou with me,
Thy circumnavigation of the world begin,
Of man, the voyage of his mind's return,
To reason's early paradise,
Back, back to wisdom's birth, to innocent intuitions,
Again with fair creation.




                                      





O we can wait no longer,
We too take ship O soul,
Joyous we too launch out on trackless seas,
Fearless for unknown shores on waves of ecstasy to sail,
Amid the wafting winds, (thou pressing me to thee, I thee to me,
O soul,)
Caroling free, singing our song of God,
Chanting our chant of pleasant exploration.

With laugh and many a kiss,
(Let others deprecate, let others weep for sin, remorse, humilia
tion,)
O soul thou pleasest me, I thee.

Ah more than any priest O soul we too believe in God,
But with the mystery of God we dare not dally.

O soul thou pleasest me, I thee,
Sailing these seas or on the hills, or waking in the night,
Thoughts, silent thoughts, of Time and Space and Death, like 
waters flowing,
Bear me indeed as through the regions infinite,
Whose air I breathe, whose ripples hear, lave me all over,
Bathe me O God in thee, mounting to thee,
I and my soul to range in range of thee.

O Thou transcendent,
Nameless, the fibre and the breath,
Light of the light, shedding forth universes, thou centre of them,
Thou mightier centre of the true, the good, the loving,
Thou moral, spiritual fountain—affection's source—thou reser
voir,
(O pensive soul of me—O thirst unsatisfied—waitest not there?
Waitest not haply for us somewhere there the Comrade perfect?)
Thou pulse—thou motive of the stars, suns, systems,
That, circling, move in order, safe, harmonious,
Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space,
How should I think, how breathe a single breath, how speak, if,
out of myself,
I could not launch, to those, superior universes?

Swiftly I shrivel at the thought of God,
At Nature and its wonders, Time and Space and Death,
But that I, turning, call to thee O soul, thou actual Me,


                                      



And lo, thou gently masterest the orbs,
Thou matest Time, smilest content at Death,
And fillest, swellest full the vastnesses of Space.

Greater than stars or suns,
Bounding O soul thou journeyest forth;
What love than thine and ours could wider amplify?
What aspirations, wishes, outvie thine and ours O soul?
What dreams of the ideal? what plans of purity, perfection,
strength?
What cheerful willingness for others' sake to give up all?
For others' sake to suffer all?

Reckoning ahead O soul, when thou, the time achiev'd,
The seas all cross'd, weather'd the capes, the voyage done,
Surrounded, copest, frontest God, yieldest, the aim attain'd,
As fill'd with friendship, love complete, the Elder Brother found,
The Younger melts in fondness in his arms.




Passage to more than India!
Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights?
O soul, voyagest thou indeed on voyages like those?
Disportest thou on waters such as those?
Soundest below the Sanscrit and the Vedas?
Then have thy bent unleash'd.

Passage to you, your shores, ye aged fierce enigmas!
Passage to you, to mastership of you, ye strangling problems!
You, strew'd with the wrecks of skeletons, that, living, never 
reach'd you.

Passage to more than India!
O secret of the earth and sky!
Of you O waters of the sea! O winding creeks and rivers!
Of you O woods and fields! of you strong mountains of my land!
Of you O prairies! of you gray rocks!
O morning red! O clouds! O rain and snows!
O day and night, passage to you!

O sun and moon and all you stars! Sirius and Jupiter!
Passage to you!

Passage, immediate passage! the blood burns in my veins!
Away O soul! hoist instantly the anchor!


                                      



Cut the hawsers—haul out—shake out every sail!
Have we not stood here like trees in the ground long enough?
Have we not grovel'd here long enough, eating and drinking like 
mere brutes?
Have we not darken'd and dazed ourselves with books long enough?

Sail forth—steer for the deep waters only,
Reckless O soul, exploring, I with thee, and thou with me,
For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go,
And we will risk the ship, ourselves and all.

O my brave soul!
O farther farther sail!
O daring joy, but safe! are they not all the seas of God?
O farther, farther, farther sail!



PRAYER OF COLUMBUS.

A BATTER'D, wreck'd old man,
Thrown on this savage shore, far, far from home,
Pent by the sea and dark rebellious brows, twelve dreary months,
Sore, stiff with many toils, sicken'd and nigh to death,
I take my way along the island's edge,
Venting a heavy heart.

I am too full of woe!
Haply I may not live another day;
I cannot rest O God, I cannot eat or drink or sleep,
Till I put forth myself, my prayer, once more to Thee,
Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee, commune with Thee,
Report myself once more to Thee.

Thou knowest my years entire, my life,
My long and crowded life of active work, not adoration merely;
Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth,
Thou knowest my manhood's solemn and visionary meditations,
Thou knowest how before I commenced I devoted all to come to 
Thee,
Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows and strictly 
kept them,
Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in Thee,


                                      



In shackles, prison'd, in disgrace, repining not,
Accepting all from Thee, as duly come from Thee.

All my emprises have been fill'd with Thee,
My speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thoughts of Thee,
Sailing the deep or journeying the land for Thee;
Intentions, purports, aspirations mine, leaving results to Thee.

O I am sure they really came from Thee,
The urge, the ardor, the unconquerable will,
The potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words,
A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep,
These sped me on.

By me and these the work so far accomplish'd,
By me earth's elder cloy'd and stifled lands uncloy'd, unloos'd,
By me the hemispheres rounded and tied, the unknown to the known.

The end I know not, it is all in Thee,
Or small or great I know not—haply what broad fields, what lands,
Haply the brutish measureless human undergrowth I know,
Transplanted there may rise to stature, knowledge worthy Thee,
Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turn'd to reaping
tools,
Haply the lifeless cross I know, Europe's dead cross, may bud and 
blossom there.

One effort more, my altar this bleak sand;
That Thou O God my life hast lighted,
With ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of Thee,
Light rare untellable, lighting the very light,
Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages;
For that O God, be it my latest word, here on my knees,
Old, poor, and paralyzed, I thank Thee.

My terminus near,
The clouds already closing in upon me,
The voyage balk'd, the course disputed, lost,
I yield my ships to Thee.

My hands, my limbs grow nerveless,
My brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd,
Let the old timbers part, I will not part,
I will cling fast to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me,
Thee, Thee at least I know.



                                      



Is it the prophet's thought I speak, or am I raving?
What do I know of life? what of myself?
I know not even my own work past or present,
Dim evershifting guesses of it spread before me,
Of newer better worlds, their mighty parturition,
Mocking, perplexing me.

And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?
As if some miracle, some hand divine unseal'd my eyes,
Shadowy vast shapes smile through the air and sky,
And on the distant waves sail countless ships,
And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.


THE SLEEPERS.



I WANDER all night in my vision,
Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and 
stopping,
Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,
Wandering and confused, lost to myself, illassorted, contradic
tory,
Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.

How solemn they look there, stretch'd and still,
How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.

The wretched features of ennuyés, the white features of corpses,
the livid faces of drunkards, the sickgray faces of onanists,
The gash'd bodies on battlefields, the insane in their strongdoor'd 
rooms, the sacred idiots, the newborn emerging from 
gates, and the dying emerging from gates,
The night pervades them and infolds them.

The married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his palm on 
the hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of 
the husband,
The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,
The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,
And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt.



                                      



The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,
The prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the runaway son sleeps,
The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep?
And the murder'd person, how does he sleep?

The female that loves unrequited sleeps,
And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,
The head of the moneymaker that plotted all day sleeps,
And the enraged and treacherous dispositions, all, all sleep.

I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worstsuffering and 
the most restless,
I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them,
The restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep.

Now I pierce the darkness, new beings appear,
The earth recedes from me into the night,
I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the earth is 
beautiful.

I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other sleepers 
each in turn,
I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,
And I become the other dreamers.

I am a dance—play up there! the fit is whirling me fast!

I am the everlaughing—it is new moon and twilight,
I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever way 
I look,
Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where it 
is neither ground nor sea.

Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,
Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,
I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides,
And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk,
To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch'd arms, and 
resume the way;
Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirthshouting 
music and wildflapping pennants of joy!

I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,
The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,
He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after today,
The stammerer, the wellform'd person, the wasted or feeble 
person.



                                      



I am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly,
My truant lover has come, and it is dark.

Double yourself and receive me darkness,
Receive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without 
him.

I roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the dusk.

He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,
He rises with me silently from the bed.

Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty and 
panting,
I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.

My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,
I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.

Be careful darkness! already what was it touch'd me?
I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,
I hear the heartbeat, I follow, I fade away.




I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,
Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.

It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman's,
I sit low in a strawbottom chair and carefully darn my grandson's 
stockings.

It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter mid
night,
I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.

A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the 
coffin,
It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is blank 
here, for reasons.

(It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be 
happy,
Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he 
has enough.)




                                      





I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the 
eddies of the sea,
His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with 
courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs,
I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,
I hate the swiftrunning eddies that would dash him headfore
most on the rocks.

What are you doing you ruffianly redtrickled waves?
Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime 
of his middle age?

Steady and long he struggles,
He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his strength holds 
out,
The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him 
away, they roll him, swing him, turn him,
His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is continually 
bruis'd on rocks,
Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.




I turn but do not extricate myself,
Confused, a pastreading, another, but with darkness yet.

The beach is cut by the razory icewind, the wreckguns sound,
The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts.

I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as 
she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter 
and fainter.

I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,
I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze 
upon me.

I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash'd to us 
alive,
In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in 
a barn.




Now of the older wardays, the defeat at Brooklyn,
Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench'd 
hills amid a crowd of officers,


                                      



His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,
He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch'd from 
his cheeks,
He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by 
their parents.

The same at last and at last when peace is declared,
He stands in the room of the old tavern, the wellbelov'd soldiers 
all pass through,
The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,
The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on 
the cheek,
He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes 
hands and bids goodby to the army.




Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner 
together,
Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents 
on the old homestead.

A red squaw came one breakfasttime to the old homestead,
On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rushbottoming 
chairs,
Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, halfenvelop'd her 
face,
Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely 
as she spoke.

My mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger,
She look'd at the freshness of her tallborne face and full and 
pliant limbs,
The more she look'd upon her she loved her,
Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,
She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she 
cook'd food for her,
She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and 
fondness.

The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of 
the afternoon she went away,
O my mother was loth to have her go away,
All the week she thought of her, she watch'd for her many a 
month,
She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,
But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.




                                      





A show of the summer softness—a contact of something unseen 
—an amour of the light and air,
I am jealous and overwhelm'd with friendliness,
And will go gallivant with the light and air myself.

O love and summer, you are in the dreams and in me,
Autumn and winter are in the dreams, the farmer goes with his 
thrift,
The droves and crops increase, the barns are wellfill'd.

Elements merge in the night, ships make tacks in the dreams,
The sailor sails, the exile returns home,
The fugitive returns unharm'd, the immigrant is back beyond 
months and years,
The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood 
with the wellknown neighbors and faces,
They warmly welcome him, he is barefoot again, he forgets he is 
well off,
The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welshman 
voyage home, and the native of the Mediterranean voy
ages home,
To every port of England, France, Spain, enter wellfill'd ships,
The Swiss foots it toward his hills, the Prussian goes his way, the 
Hungarian his way, and the Pole his way,
The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.

The homeward bound and the outward bound,
The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuyé, the onanist, the female 
that loves unrequited, the moneymaker,
The actor and actress, those through with their parts and those 
waiting to commence,
The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee 
that is chosen and the nominee that has fail'd,
The great already known and the great any time after today,
The stammerer, the sick, the perfectform'd, the homely,
The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sen
tenced him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience,
The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red 
squaw,
The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is wrong'd,
The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,
I swear they are averaged now—one is no better than the other,
The night and sleep have liken'd them and restored them.



                                      



I swear they are all beautiful,
Every one that sleeps is beautiful, every thing in the dim light is 
beautiful,
The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace.

Peace is always beautiful,
The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.

The myth of heaven indicates the soul,
The soul is always beautiful, it appears more or it appears less, it 
comes or it lags behind,
It comes from its embower'd garden and looks pleasantly on 
itself and encloses the world,
Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and perfect and 
clean the womb cohering,
The head wellgrown proportion'd and plumb, and the bowels and 
joints proportion'd and plumb.

The soul is always beautiful,
The universe is duly in order, every thing is in its place,
What has arrived is in its place and what waits shall be in its place,
The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,
The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child 
of the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits 
long,
The sleepers that lived and died wait, the far advanced are to go 
on in their turns, and the far behind are to come on in 
their turns,
The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite 
—they unite now.




The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,
They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to west as 
they lie unclothed,
The Asiatic and African are hand in hand, the European and 
American are hand in hand,
Learn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and female are 
hand in hand,
The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover, they 
press close without lust, his lips press her neck,
The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with meas
ureless love, and the son holds the father in his arms with 
measureless love,


                                      



The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the 
daughter,
The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is 
inarm'd by friend,
The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the scholar,
the wrong'd is made right,
The call of the slave is one with the master's call, and the master 
salutes the slave,
The felon steps forth from the prison, the insane becomes sane,
the suffering of sick persons is reliev'd,
The sweatings and fevers stop, the throat that was unsound is 
sound, the lungs of the consumptive are resumed, the poor 
distress'd head is free,
The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and 
smoother than ever,
Stiflings and passages open, the paralyzed become supple,
The swell'd and convuls'd and congested awake to themselves in 
condition,
They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of the 
night, and awake.

I too pass from the night,
I stay a while away O night, but I return to you again and love you.

Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you?
I am not afraid, I have been well brought forward by you,
I love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay 
so long,
I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go with 
you, but I know I came well and shall go well.

I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes,
I will duly pass the day O my mother, and duly return to you.



TRANSPOSITIONS.

LET the reformers descend from the stands where they are forever 
bawling—let an idiot or insane person appear on each of 
the stands;
Let judges and criminals be transposed—let the prisonkeepers be 
put in prison—let those that were prisoners take the keys;
Let them that distrust birth and death lead the rest.



                                      




TO THINK OF TIME.



TO think of time—of all that retrospection,
To think of today, and the ages continued henceforward.

Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?
Have you dreaded these earthbeetles?
Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?

Is today nothing? is the beginningless past nothing?
If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing.

To think that the sun rose in the east—that men and women 
were flexible, real, alive—that every thing was alive,
To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part,
To think that we are now here and bear our part.




Not a day passes, not a minute or second without an accouche
ment,
Not a day passes, not a minute or second without a corpse.

The dull nights go over and the dull days also,
The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,
The physician after long putting off gives the silent and terrible 
look for an answer,
The children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and 
sisters are sent for,
Medicines stand unused on the shelf, (the camphorsmell has long 
pervaded the rooms,)
The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the 
dying,
The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,
The breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases,
The corpse stretches on the bed and the living look upon it,
It is palpable as the living are palpable.

The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,
But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously 
on the corpse.




To think the thought of death merged in the thought of materials,
To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking 
great interest in them, and we taking no interest in them.



                                      



To think how eager we are in building our houses,
To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent.

(I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or 
seventy or eighty years at most,
I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.)

Slowmoving and black lines creep over the whole earth—they 
never cease—they are the burial lines,
He that was President was buried, and he that is now President 
shall surely be buried.




A reminiscence of the vulgar fate,
A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,
Each after his kind.

Cold dash of waves at the ferrywharf, posh and ice in the river,
halffrozen mud in the streets,
A gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last daylight of 
December,
A hearse and stages, the funeral of an old Broadway stagedriver,
the cortege mostly drivers.

Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the deathbell,
The gate is pass'd, the newdug grave is halted at, the living alight,
the hearse uncloses,
The coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid on 
the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,
The mound above is flatted with the spades—silence,
A minute—no one moves or speaks—it is done,
He is decently put away—is there any thing more?

He was a good fellow, freemouth'd, quicktemper'd, not bad
looking,
Ready with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled,
ate hearty, drank hearty,
Had known what it was to be flush, grew lowspirited toward the 
last, sicken'd, was help'd by a contribution,
Died, aged fortyone years—and that was his funeral.

Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet
weather clothes, whip carefully chosen,
Boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody loafing on you, you loafing 
on somebody, headway, man before and man behind,
Good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock, first out,
last out, turningin at night,


                                      



To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers, and 
he there takes no interest in them.




The markets, the government, the workingman's wages, to think 
what account they are through our nights and days,
To think that other workingmen will make just as great account 
of them, yet we make little or no account.

The vulgar and the refined, what you call sin and what you call 
goodness, to think how wide a difference,
To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie 
beyond the difference.

To think how much pleasure there is,
Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or 
planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and 
family?
Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or 
the beautiful maternal cares?
These also flow onward to others, you and I flow onward,
But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them.

Your farm, profits, crops—to think how engross'd you are,
To think there will still be farms, profits, crops, yet for you of 
what avail?




What will be will be well, for what is is well,
To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.

The domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building 
of houses, are not phantasms, they have weight, form,
location,
Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of 
them phantasms,
The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,
The earth is not an echo, man and his life and all the things of 
his life are wellconsider'd.

You are not thrown to the winds, you gather certainly and safely 
around yourself,
Yourself! yourself! yourself, for ever and ever!




It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and 
father, it is to identify you,


                                      



It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be 
decided,
Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you,
You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.

The threads that were spun are gather'd, the weft crosses the warp,
the pattern is systematic.

The preparations have every one been justified,
The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments, the baton 
has given the signal.

The guest that was coming, he waited long, he is now housed,
He is one of those who are beautiful and happy, he is one of those 
that to look upon and be with is enough.

The law of the past cannot be eluded,
The law of the present and future cannot be eluded,
The law of the living cannot be eluded, it is eternal,
The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,
The law of heroes and gooddoers cannot be eluded,
The law of drunkards, informers, mean persons, not one iota 
thereof can be eluded.




Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,
Northerner goes carried and Southerner goes carried, and they on 
the Atlantic side and they on the Pacific,
And they between, and all through the Mississippi country, and 
all over the earth.

The great masters and kosmos are well as they go, the heroes and 
gooddoers are well,
The known leaders and inventors and the rich owners and pious 
and distinguish'd may be well,
But there is more account than that, there is strict account of 
all.

The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not 
nothing,
The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,
The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as 
they go.

Of and in all these things,
I have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor the 
law of us changed,


                                      



I have dream'd that heroes and gooddoers shall be under the 
present and past law,
And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present 
and past law,
For I have dream'd that the law they are under now is enough.

And I have dream'd that the purpose and essence of the known 
life, the transient,
Is to form and decide identity for the unknown life, the permanent.

If all came but to ashes of dung,
If maggots and rats ended us, then Alarum! for we are betray'd,
Then indeed suspicion of death.

Do you suspect death? if I were to suspect death I should die 
now,
Do you think I could walk pleasantly and wellsuited toward 
annihilation?

Pleasantly and wellsuited I walk,
Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,
The whole universe indicates that it is good,
The past and the present indicate that it is good.

How beautiful and perfect are the animals!
How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!
What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as 
perfect,
The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable 
fluids perfect;
Slowly and surely they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and surely 
they yet pass on.




I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an 
eternal soul!
The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have!
the animals!

I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!
That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it,
and the cohering is for it!
And all preparation is for it—and identity is for it—and life and 
materials are altogether for it!




                                      




WHISPERS OF HEAVENLY DEATH.



—————


DAREST THOU NOW O SOUL.

DAREST thou now O soul,
Walk out with me toward the unknown region,
Where neither ground is for the feet nor any path to follow?

No map there, nor guide,
Nor voice sounding, nor touch of human hand,
Nor face with blooming flesh, nor lips, nor eyes, are in that land.

I know it not O soul,
Nor dost thou, all is a blank before us,
All waits undream'd of in that region, that inaccessible land.

Till when the ties loosen,
All but the ties eternal, Time and Space,
Nor darkness, gravitation, sense, nor any bounds bounding us.

Then we burst forth, we float,
In Time and Space O soul, prepared for them,
Equal, equipt at last, (O joy! O fruit of all!) them to fulfil O 
soul.


WHISPERS OF HEAVENLY DEATH.

WHISPERS of heavenly death murmur'd I hear,
Labial gossip of night, sibilant chorals,
Footsteps gently ascending, mystical breezes wafted soft and low,
Ripples of unseen rivers, tides of a current flowing, forever flowing,
(Or is it the plashing of tears? the measureless waters of human 
tears?)

I see, just see skyward, great cloudmasses,
Mournfully slowly they roll, silently swelling and mixing,
With at times a halfdimm'd sadden'd faroff star,
Appearing and disappearing.

(Some parturition rather, some solemn immortal birth;
On the frontiers to eyes impenetrable,
Some soul is passing over.)



                                      




CHANTING THE SQUARE DEIFIC.



CHANTING the square deific, out of the One advancing, out of the 
sides,
Out of the old and new, out of the square entirely divine,
Solid, foursided, (all the sides needed,) from this side Jehovah 
am I,
Old Brahm I, and I Saturnius am;
Not Time affects me—I am Time, old, modern as any,
Unpersuadable, relentless, executing righteous judgments,
As the Earth, the Father, the brown old Kronos, with laws,
Aged beyond computation, yet ever new, ever with those mighty 
laws rolling,
Relentless I forgive no man—whoever sins dies—I will have 
that man's life;
Therefore let none expect mercy—have the seasons, gravitation, 
the appointed days, mercy? no more have I,
But as the seasons and gravitation, and as all the appointed days 
that forgive not,
I dispense from this side judgments inexorable without the least 
remorse.




Consolator most mild, the promis'd one advancing,
With gentle hand extended, the mightier God am I,
Foretold by prophets and poets in their most rapt prophecies and 
poems,
From this side, lo! the Lord Christ gazes—lo! Hermes I—lo! 
mine is Hercules' face,
All sorrow, labor, suffering, I, tallying it, absorb in myself,
Many times have I been rejected, taunted, put in prison, and 
crucified, and many times shall be again,
All the world have I given up for my dear brothers' and sisters' 
sake, for the soul's sake,
Wending my way through the homes of men, rich or poor, with 
the kiss of affection,
For I am affection, I am the cheerbringing God, with hope and 
allenclosing charity,
With indulgent words as to children, with fresh and sane words, 
mine only,
Young and strong I pass knowing well I am destin'd myself to an 
early death;
But my charity has no death—my wisdom dies not, neither early 
nor late,
And my sweet love bequeath'd here and elsewhere never dies.




                                      





Aloof, dissatisfied, plotting revolt,
Comrade of criminals, brother of slaves,
Crafty, despised, a drudge, ignorant,
With sudra face and worn brow, black, but in the depths of my 
heart, proud as any,
Lifted now and always against whoever scorning assumes to rule me,
Morose, full of guile, full of reminiscences, brooding, with many 
wiles,
(Though it was thought I was baffled and dispel'd, and my wiles 
done, but that will never be,)
Defiant, I, Satan, still live, still utter words, in new lands duly 
appearing, (and old ones also,)
Permanent here from my side, warlike, equal with any, real as any,
Nor time nor change shall ever change me or my words.




Santa Spirita, breather, life,
Beyond the light, lighter than light,
Beyond the flames of hell, joyous, leaping easily above hell,
Beyond Paradise, perfumed solely with mine own perfume,
Including all life on earth, touching, including God, including 
Saviour and Satan,
Ethereal, pervading all, (for without me what were all? what were 
God?)
Essence of forms, life of the real identities, permanent, positive, 
(namely the unseen,)
Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man, 
I, the general soul,
Here the square finishing, the solid, I the most solid,
Breathe my breath also through these songs.



OF HIM I LOVE DAY AND NIGHT.

OF him I love day and night I dream'd I heard he was dead,
And I dream'd I went where they had buried him I love, but he 
was not in that place,
And I dream'd I wander'd searching among burialplaces to find 
him,
And I found that every place was a burialplace;
The houses full of life were equally full of death, (this house is 
now,)
The streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the Chicago,
Boston, Philadelphia, the Mannahatta, were as full of the 
dead as of the living,


                                      



And fuller, O vastly fuller of the dead than of the living;
And what I dream'd I will henceforth tell to every person and age,
And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream'd,
And now I am willing to disregard burialplaces and dispense 
with them,
And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently every
where, even in the room where I eat or sleep, I should be 
satisfied,
And if the corpse of any one I love, or if my own corpse, be 
duly render'd to powder and pour'd in the sea, I shall be 
satisfied,
Or if it be distributed to the winds I shall be satisfied.


YET, YET, YE DOWNCAST HOURS.

YET, yet, ye downcast hours, I know ye also,
Weights of lead, how ye clog and cling at my ankles,
Earth to a chamber of mourning turns—I hear the o'erweening,
mocking voice,
Matter is conqueror—matter, triumphant only, continues onward.

Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me,
The call of my nearest lover, putting forth, alarm'd, uncertain,
The sea I am quickly to sail, come tell me,
Come tell me where I am speeding, tell me my destination.

I understand your anguish, but I cannot help you,
I approach, hear, behold, the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes,
your mute inquiry,
Whither I go from the bed I recline on, come tell me;
Old age, alarm'd, uncertain—a young woman's voice, appealing 
to me for comfort;
A young man's voice, Shall I not escape?


AS IF A PHANTOM CARESS'D ME.

AS if a phantom caress'd me,
I thought I was not alone walking here by the shore;
But the one I thought was with me as now I walk by the shore,
the one I loved that caress'd me,
As I lean and look through the glimmering light, that one has 
utterly disappear'd,
And those appear that are hateful to me and mock me.



                                      




ASSURANCES.

I NEED no assurances, I am a man who is preoccupied of his 
own soul;
I do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and 
face I am cognizant of, are now looking faces I am not 
cognizant of, calm and actual faces,
I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent 
in any iota of the world,
I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes are limitless,
in vain I try to think how limitless,
I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their 
swift sports through the air on purpose, and that I shall one 
day be eligible to do as much as they, and more than they,
I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of 
years,
I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors have 
their exteriors, and that the eyesight has another eyesight,
and the hearing another hearing, and the voice another 
voice,
I do not doubt that the passionatelywept deaths of young men 
are provided for, and that the deaths of young women and 
the deaths of little children are provided for,
(Did you think Life was so well provided for, and Death, the pur
port of all Life, is not well provided for?)
I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter what the horrors of 
them, no matter whose wife, child, husband, father, lover,
has gone down, are provided for, to the minutest points,
I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at 
any time, is provided for in the inherences of things,
I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space, but I 
believe Heavenly Death provides for all.


QUICKSAND YEARS.

QUICKSAND years that whirl me I know not whither,
Your schemes, politics, fail, lines give way, substances mock and 
elude me,
Only the theme I sing, the great and strongpossess'd soul, eludes 
not,
One'sself must never give way—that is the final substance—
that out of all is sure,
Out of politics, triumphs, battles, life, what at last finally remains?
When shows break up what but One'sSelf is sure?



                                      




THAT MUSIC ALWAYS ROUND ME.

THAT music always round me, unceasing, unbeginning, yet long 
untaught I did not hear,
But now the chorus I hear and am elated,
A tenor, strong, ascending with power and health, with glad notes 
of daybreak I hear,
A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense 
waves,
A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the 
universe,
The triumphant tutti, the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and 
violins, all these I fill myself with,
I hear not the volumes of sound merely, I am moved by the 
exquisite meanings,
I listen to the different voices winding in and out, striving, contend
ing with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion;
I do not think the performers know themselves—but now I think 
I begin to know them.


WHAT SHIP PUZZLED AT SEA.

WHAT ship puzzled at sea, cons for the true reckoning?
Or coming in, to avoid the bars and follow the channel a perfect 
pilot needs?
Here, sailor! here, ship! take aboard the most perfect pilot,
Whom, in a little boat, putting off and rowing, I hailing you offer.


A NOISELESS PATIENT SPIDER.

A NOISELESS patient spider,
I mark'd where on a little promontory it stood isolated,
Mark'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,
It launch'd forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,
Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.

And you O my soul where you stand,
Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,
Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to 
connect them,
Till the bridge you will need be form'd, till the ductile anchor 
hold,
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.



                                      




O LIVING ALWAYS, ALWAYS DYING.

O LIVING always, always dying!
O the burials of me past and present,
O me while I stride ahead, material, visible, imperious as ever;
O me, what I was for years, now dead, (I lament not, I am 
content;)
O to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which I turn 
and look at where I cast them,
To pass on, (O living! always living!) and leave the corpses 
behind.


TO ONE SHORTLY TO DIE.

FROM all the rest I single out you, having a message for you,
You are to die—let others tell you what they please, I cannot 
prevaricate,
I am exact and merciless, but I love you—there is no escape for 
you.

Softly I lay my right hand upon you, you just feel it,
I do not argue, I bend my head close and half envelop it,
I sit quietly by, I remain faithful,
I am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbor,
I absolve you from all except yourself spiritual bodily, that is eter
nal, you yourself will surely escape,
The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious.

The sun bursts through in unlookedfor directions,
Strong thoughts fill you and confidence, you smile,
You forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick,
You do not see the medicines, you do not mind the weeping 
friends, I am with you,
I exclude others from you, there is nothing to be commiserated,
I do not commiserate, I congratulate you.


NIGHT ON THE PRAIRIES.

NIGHT on the prairies,
The supper is over, the fire on the ground burns low,
The wearied emigrants sleep, wrapt in their blankets;
I walk by myself—I stand and look at the stars, which I think now 
I never realized before.



                                      



Now I absorb immortality and peace,
I admire death and test propositions.

How plenteous! how spiritual! how resumé!
The same old man and soul—the same old aspirations, and the 
same content.

I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the notday 
exhibited,
I was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so noiseless 
around me myriads of other globes.

Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I will 
measure myself by them,
And now touch'd with the lives of other globes arrived as far 
along as those of the earth,
Or waiting to arrive, or pass'd on farther than those of the earth,
I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,
Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive.

O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me, as the day cannot,
I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.


THOUGHT.

AS I sit with others at a great feast, suddenly while the music is 
playing,
To my mind, (whence it comes I know not,) spectral in mist of 
a wreck at sea,
Of certain ships, how they sail from port with flying streamers and 
wafted kisses, and that is the last of them,
Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President,
Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founder'd 
off the Northeast coast and going down—of the steamship 
Arctic going down,
Of the veil'd tableau—women gather'd together on deck, pale,
heroic, waiting the moment that draws so close—O the 
moment!
A huge sob—a few bubbles—the white foam spirting up—and 
then the women gone,
Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on—and I now 
pondering, Are those women indeed gone?
Are souls drown'd and destroy'd so?
Is only matter triumphant?



                                      




THE LAST INVOCATION.

AT the last, tenderly,
From the walls of the powerful fortress'd house,
From the clasp of the knitted locks, from the keep of the well
closed doors,
Let me be wafted.

Let me glide noiselessly forth;
With the key of softness unlock the locks—with a whisper,
Set ope the doors O soul.

Tenderly—be not impatient,
(Strong is your hold O mortal flesh,
Strong is your hold O love.)


AS I WATCH'D THE PLOUGHMAN PLOUGHING.

AS I watch'd the ploughman ploughing,
Or the sower sowing in the fields, or the harvester harvesting,
I saw there too, O life and death, your analogies;
(Life, life is the tillage, and Death is the harvest according.)


PENSIVE AND FALTERING.

PENSIVE and faltering,
The words the Dead I write,
For living are the Dead,
(Haply the only living, only real,
And I the apparition, I the spectre.)

THOU MOTHER WITH THY EQUAL BROOD.



THOU Mother with thy equal brood,
Thou varied chain of different States, yet one identity only,
A special song before I go I'd sing o'er all the rest,
For thee, the future.



                                      



I'd sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,
I'd fashion thy ensemble including body and soul,
I'd show away ahead thy real Union, and how it may be accom
plish'd.

The paths to the house I seek to make,
But leave to those to come the house itself.

Belief I sing, and preparation;
As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present 
only,
But greater still from what is yet to come,
Out of that formula for thee I sing.




As a strong bird on pinions free,
Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,
Such be the thought I'd think of thee America,
Such be the recitative I'd bring for thee.

The conceits of the poets of other lands I'd bring thee not,
Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,
Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of foreign court or 
indoor library;
But an odor I'd bring as from forests of pine in Maine, or breath 
of an Illinois prairie,
With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee, or from Texas 
uplands, or Florida's glades,
Or the Saguenay's black stream, or the wide blue spread of 
Huron,
With presentment of Yellowstone's scenes, or Yosemite,
And murmuring under, pervading all, I'd bring the rustling sea
sound,
That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world.

And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,
Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, mindformulas fitted 
for thee, real and sane and large as these and thee,
Thou! mounting higher, diving deeper than we knew, thou 
transcendental Union!
By thee fact to be justified, blended with thought,
Thought of man justified, blended with God,
Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality!
Through thy reality, lo, the immortal idea!




                                      





Brain of the New World, what a task is thine,
To formulate the Modern—out of the peerless grandeur of the 
modern,
Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast poems, churches, art,
(Recast, maybe discard them, end them—maybe their work is 
done, who knows?)
By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the mighty 
past, the dead,
To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present.

And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old 
World brain,
Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long,
Thou carefully prepared by it so long—haply thou but unfoldest 
it, only maturest it,
It to eventuate in thee—the essence of the bygone time contain'd 
in thee,
Its poems, churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, destined with 
reference to thee;
Thou but the apples, long, long, long agrowing,
The fruit of all the Old ripening today in thee.




Sail, sail thy best, ship of Democracy,
Of value is thy freight, 'tis not the Present only,
The Past is also stored in thee,
Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone, not of the Western 
continent alone,
Earth's résumé entire floats on thy keel O ship, is steadied by thy 
spars,
With thee Time voyages in trust, the antecedent nations sink or 
swim with thee,
With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars, thou 
bear'st the other continents,
Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destinationport triumphant;
Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye O helmsman, thou 
carriest great companions,
Venerable priestly Asia sails this day with thee,
And royal feudal Europe sails with thee.




Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes,
Like a limitless golden cloud filling the western sky,


                                      



Emblem of general maternity lifted above all,
Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons,
Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in ceaseless procession 
issuing,
Acceding from such gestation, taking and giving continual strength 
and life,
World of the real—world of the twain in one,
World of the soul, born by the world of the real alone, led to 
identity, body, by it alone,
Yet in beginning only, incalculable masses of composite precious 
materials,
By history's cycles forwarded, by every nation, language, hither 
sent,
Ready, collected here, a freer, vast, electric world, to be con
structed here,
(The true New World, the world of orbic science, morals, litera
tures to come,)
Thou wonder world yet undefined, unform'd, neither do I define 
thee,
How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future?
I feel thy ominous greatness evil as well as good,
I watch thee advancing, absorbing the present, transcending the 
past,
I see thy light lighting, and thy shadow shadowing, as if the 
entire globe,
But I do not undertake to define thee, hardly to comprehend thee,
I but thee name, thee prophesy, as now,
I merely thee ejaculate!

Thee in thy future,
Thee in thy only permanent life, career, thy own unloosen'd mind,
thy soaring spirit,
Thee as another equally needed sun, radiant, ablaze, swiftmoving,
fructifying all,
Thee risen in potent cheerfulness and joy, in endless great 
hilarity,
Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long, that weigh'd so 
long upon the mind of man,
The doubt, suspicion, dread, of gradual, certain decadence of man;
Thee in thy larger, saner brood of female, male—thee in thy 
athletes, moral, spiritual, South, North, West, East,
(To thy immortal breasts, Mother of All, thy every daughter, son,
endear'd alike, forever equal,)
Thee in thy own musicians, singers, artists, unborn yet, but cer
tain,


                                      



Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization, (until which thy proud
est material civilization must remain in vain,)
Thee in thy allsupplying, allenclosing worship—thee in no single 
bible, saviour, merely,
Thy saviours countless, latent within thyself, thy bibles incessant 
within thyself, equal to any, divine as any,
(Thy soaring course thee formulating, not in thy two great wars,
nor in thy century's visible growth,
But far more in these leaves and chants, thy chants, great Mother!)
Thee in an education grown of thee, in teachers, studies, students,
born of thee,
Thee in thy democratic fêtes enmasse, thy high original festivals,
operas, lecturers, preachers,
Thee in thy ultimata, (the preparations only now completed, the 
edifice on sure foundations tied,)
Thee in thy pinnacles, intellect, thought, thy topmost rational joys,
thy love and godlike aspiration,
In thy resplendent coming literati, thy fulllung'd orators, thy 
sacerdotal bards, kosmic savans,
These! these in thee, (certain to come,) today I prophesy.




Land tolerating all, accepting all, not for the good alone, all good 
for thee,
Land in the realms of God to be a realm unto thyself,
Under the rule of God to be a rule unto thyself.

(Lo, where arise three peerless stars,
To be thy natal stars my country, Ensemble, Evolution, Freedom,
Set in the sky of Law.)

Land of unprecedented faith, God's faith,
Thy soil, thy very subsoil, all upheav'd,
The general inner earth so long so sedulously draped over, now 
hence for what it is boldly laid bare,
Open'd by thee to heaven's light for benefit or bale.

Not for success alone,
Not to fairsail unintermitted always,
The storm shall dash thy face, the murk of war and worse than 
war shall cover thee all over,
(Wert capable of war, its tug and trials? be capable of peace, its 
trials,
For the tug and mortal strain of nations come at last in prosper
ous peace, not war;)


                                      



In many a smiling mask death shall approach beguiling thee, thou 
in disease shalt swelter,
The livid cancer spread its hideous claws, clinging upon thy 
breasts, seeking to strike thee deep within,
Consumption of the worst, moral consumption, shall rouge thy 
face with hectic,
But thou shalt face thy fortunes, thy diseases, and surmount them 
all,
Whatever they are today and whatever through time they may be,
They each and all shall lift and pass away and cease from thee,
While thou, Time's spirals rounding, out of thyself, thyself still 
extricating, fusing,
Equable, natural, mystical Union thou, (the mortal with immortal 
blent,)
Shalt soar toward the fulfilment of the future, the spirit of the 
body and the mind,
The soul, its destinies.

The soul, its destinies, the real real,
(Purport of all these apparitions of the real;)
In thee America, the soul, its destinies,
Thou globe of globes! thou wonder nebulous!
By many a throe of heat and cold convuls'd, (by these thyself 
solidifying,)
Thou mental, moral orb—thou New, indeed new, Spiritual World!
The Present holds thee not—for such vast growth as thine,
For such unparallel'd flight as thine, such brood as thine,
The FUTURE only holds thee and can hold thee.



A PAUMANOK PICTURE.

TWO boats with nets lying off the seabeach, quite still,
Ten fishermen waiting—they discover a thick school of moss
bonkers—they drop the join'd seineends in the water,
The boats separate and row off, each on its rounding course to the 
beach, enclosing the mossbonkers,
The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,
Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats, others stand ankle
deep in the water, pois'd on strong legs,
The boats partly drawn up, the water slapping against them,
Strew'd on the sand in heaps and windrows, well out from the 
water, the greenback'd spotted mossbonkers.


                                      




FROM NOON TO STARRY NIGHT.



—————


THOU ORB ALOFT FULLDAZZLING.

THOU orb aloft fulldazzling! thou hot October noon!
Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand,
The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam,
And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue;
O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.

Hear me illustrious!
Thy lover me, for always I have loved thee,
Even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some wood edge,
thy touchingdistant beams enough,
Or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my 
invocation.

(Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive,
I know before the fitting man all Nature yields,
Though answering not in words, the skies, trees, hear his voice—
and thou O sun,
As for thy throes, thy perturbations, sudden breaks and shafts of 
flame gigantic,
I understand them, I know those flames, those perturbations well.)

Thou that with fructifying heat and light,
O'er myriad farms, o'er lands and waters North and South,
O'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas' grassy plains, Kana
da's woods,
O'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space,
Thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas,
Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so 
liberally,
Shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting ray out of 
thy million millions,
Strike through these chants.

Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these,
Prepare the later afternoon of me myself—prepare my lengthen
ing shadows,
Prepare my starry nights.



                                      




FACES.



SAUNTERING the pavement or riding the country byroad, lo, such 
faces!
Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality,
The spiritualprescient face, the always welcome common benevo
lent face,
The face of the singing of music, the grand faces of natural law
yers and judges broad at the backtop,
The faces of hunters and fishers bulged at the brows, the shaved 
blanch'd faces of orthodox citizens,
The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist's face,
The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the handsome detested or 
despised face,
The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the mother of 
many children,
The face of an amour, the face of veneration,
The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock,
The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated face,
A wild hawk, his wings clipp'd by the clipper,
A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of the gelder.

Sauntering the pavement thus, or crossing the ceaseless ferry, faces 
and faces and faces,
I see them and complain not, and am content with all.




Do you suppose I could be content with all if I thought them 
their own finalè?

This now is too lamentable a face for a man,
Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing for it,
Some milknosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig to its hole.

This face is a dog's snout sniffing for garbage,
Snakes nest in that mouth, I hear the sibilant threat.

This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea,
Its sleepy and wabbling icebergs crunch as they go.

This is a face of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they need no label,
And more of the drugshelf, laudanum, caoutchouc, or hog'slard.



                                      



This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly 
cry,
Its veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till they show nothing 
but their whites,
Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by the turn'din 
nails,
The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground, while he 
speculates well.

This face is bitten by vermin and worms,
And this is some murderer's knife with a halfpull'd scabbard.

This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee,
An unceasing deathbell tolls there.




Features of my equals would you trick me with your creas'd and 
cadaverous march?
Well, you cannot trick me.

I see your rounded nevererased flow,
I see 'neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises.

Splay and twist as you like, poke with the tangling fores of fishes 
or rats,
You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will.

I saw the face of the most smear'd and slobbering idiot they had 
at the asylum,
And I knew for my consolation what they knew not,
I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother,
The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement,
And I shall look again in a score or two of ages,
And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and unharm'd, every 
inch as good as myself.




The Lord advances, and yet advances,
Always the shadow in front, always the reach'd hand bringing up 
the laggards.

Out of this face emerge banners and horses—O superb! I see 
what is coming,
I see the high pioneercaps, see staves of runners clearing the way,
I hear victorious drums.



                                      



This face is a lifeboat,
This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no odds of the 
rest,
This face is flavor'd fruit ready for eating,
This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good.

These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake,
They show their descent from the Master himself.

Off the word I have spoken I except not one—red, white, black, 
are all deific,
In each house is the ovum, it comes forth after a thousand years.

Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me,
Tall and sufficient stand behind and make signs to me,
I read the promise and patiently wait.

This is a fullgrown lily's face,
She speaks to the limberhipp'd man near the garden pickets,
Come here she blushingly cries, Come nigh to me limberhipp'd 
man,
Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon you,
Fill me with albescent honey, bend down to me,
Rub to me with your chafing beard, rub to my breast and 
shoulders.




The old face of the mother of many children,
Whist! I am fully content.

Lull'd and late is the smoke of the Firstday morning,
It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences,
It hangs thin by the sassafras and wildcherry and catbrier under 
them.

I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,
I heard what the singers were singing so long,
Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and the 
waterblue.

Behold a woman!
She looks out from her quaker cap, her face is clearer and more 
beautiful than the sky.

She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse,
The sun just shines on her old white head.



                                      



Her ample gown is of creamhued linen,
Her grandsons raised the flax, and her granddaughters spun it 
with the distaff and the wheel.

The melodious character of the earth,
The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish 
to go,
The justified mother of men.



THE MYSTIC TRUMPETER.



HARK, some wild trumpeter, some strange musician,
Hovering unseen in air, vibrates capricious tunes tonight.

I hear thee trumpeter, listening alert I catch thy notes,
Now pouring, whirling like a tempest round me,
Now low, subdued, now in the distance lost.




Come nearer bodiless one, haply in thee resounds
Some dead composer, haply thy pensive life
Was fill'd with aspirations high, unform'd ideals,
Waves, oceans musical, chaotically surging,
That now ecstatic ghost, close to me bending, thy cornet echoing, 
pealing,
Gives out to no one's ears but mine, but freely gives to mine,
That I may thee translate.




Blow trumpeter free and clear, I follow thee,
While at thy liquid prelude, glad, serene,
The fretting world, the streets, the noisy hours of day withdraw,
A holy calm descends like dew upon me,
I walk in cool refreshing night the walks of Paradise,
I scent the grass, the moist air and the roses;
Thy song expands my numb'd imbonded spirit, thou freest, 
launchest me,
Floating and basking upon heaven's lake.




Blow again trumpeter! and for my sensuous eyes,
Bring the old pageants, show the feudal world.



                                      



What charm thy music works! thou makest pass before me,
Ladies and cavaliers long dead, barons are in their castle halls, the 
troubadours are singing,
Arm'd knights go forth to redress wrongs, some in quest of the 
holy Graal;
I see the tournament, I see the contestants incased in heavy 
armor seated on stately champing horses,
I hear the shouts, the sounds of blows and smiting steel;
I see the Crusaders' tumultuous armies—hark, how the cymbals 
clang,
Lo, where the monks walk in advance, bearing the cross on high.




Blow again trumpeter! and for thy theme,
Take now the enclosing theme of all, the solvent and the setting,
Love, that is pulse of all, the sustenance and the pang,
The heart of man and woman all for love,
No other theme but love—knitting, enclosing, alldiffusing love.

O how the immortal phantoms crowd around me!
I see the vast alembic ever working, I see and know the flames 
that heat the world,
The glow, the blush, the beating hearts of lovers,
So blissful happy some, and some so silent, dark, and nigh to 
death;
Love, that is all the earth to lovers—love, that mocks time and 
space,
Love, that is day and night—love, that is sun and moon and stars,
Love, that is crimson, sumptuous, sick with perfume,
No other words but words of love, no other thought but love.




Blow again trumpeter—conjure war's alarums.

Swift to thy spell a shuddering hum like distant thunder rolls,
Lo, where the arm'd men hasten—lo, mid the clouds of dust the 
glint of bayonets,
I see the grimefaced cannoneers, I mark the rosy flash amid the 
smoke, I hear the cracking of the guns;
Nor war alone—thy fearful musicsong, wild player, brings every 
sight of fear,
The deeds of ruthless brigands, rapine, murder—I hear the cries 
for help!
I see ships foundering at sea, I behold on deck and below deck 
the terrible tableaus.




                                      





O trumpeter, methinks I am myself the instrument thou playest,
Thou melt'st my heart, my brain—thou movest, drawest, chan
gest them at will;
And now thy sullen notes send darkness through me,
Thou takest away all cheering light, all hope,
I see the enslaved, the overthrown, the hurt, the opprest of the 
whole earth,
I feel the measureless shame and humiliation of my race, it 
becomes all mine,
Mine too the revenges of humanity, the wrongs of ages, baffled 
feuds and hatreds,
Utter defeat upon me weighs—all lost—the foe victorious,
(Yet 'mid the ruins Pride colossal stands unshaken to the last,
Endurance, resolution to the last.)




Now trumpeter for thy close,
Vouchsafe a higher strain than any yet,
Sing to my soul, renew its languishing faith and hope,
Rouse up my slow belief, give me some vision of the future,
Give me for once its prophecy and joy.

O glad, exulting, culminating song!
A vigor more than earth's is in thy notes,
Marches of victory—man disenthral'd—the conqueror at last,
Hymns to the universal God from universal man—all joy!
A reborn race appears—a perfect world, all joy!
Women and men in wisdom innocence and health—all joy!
Riotous laughing bacchanals fill'd with joy!
War, sorrow, suffering gone—the rank earth purged—nothing 
but joy left!
The ocean fill'd with joy—the atmosphere all joy!
Joy! joy! in freedom, worship, love! joy in the ecstasy of life!
Enough to merely be! enough to breathe!
Joy! joy! all over joy!



TO A LOCOMOTIVE IN WINTER.

THEE for my recitative,
Thee in the driving storm even as now, the snow, the winterday 
declining,
Thee in thy panoply, thy measur'd dual throbbing and thy beat 
convulsive,


                                      



Thy black cylindric body, golden brass and silvery steel,
Thy ponderous sidebars, parallel and connecting rods, gyrating,
shuttling at thy sides,
Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar, now tapering in the 
distance,
Thy great protruding headlight fix'd in front,
Thy long, pale, floating vaporpennants, tinged with delicate 
purple,
The dense and murky clouds outbelching from thy smokestack,
Thy knitted frame, thy springs and valves, the tremulous twinkle 
of thy wheels,
Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily following,
Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily careering;
Type of the modern—emblem of motion and power—pulse of 
the continent,
For once come serve the Muse and merge in verse, even as here 
I see thee,
With storm and buffeting gusts of wind and falling snow,
By day thy warning ringing bell to sound its notes,
By night thy silent signal lamps to swing.

Fiercethroated beauty!
Roll through my chant with all thy lawless music, thy swinging 
lamps at night,
Thy madlywhistled laughter, echoing, rumbling like an earth
quake, rousing all,
Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding,
(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine,)
Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,
Launch'd o'er the prairies wide, across the lakes,
To the free skies unpent and glad and strong.


O MAGNETSOUTH.

O MAGNETSOUTH! O glistening perfumed South! my South!
O quick mettle, rich blood, impulse and love! good and evil! O 
all dear to me!
O dear to me my birththings—all moving things and the trees 
where I was born—the grains, plants, rivers,
Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow, distant,
over flats of silvery sands or through swamps,
Dear to me the Roanoke, the Savannah, the Altamahaw, the 
Pedee, the Tombigbee, the Santee, the Coosa and the 
Sabine,


                                      



O pensive, far away wandering, I return with my soul to haunt 
their banks again,
Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes, I float on the Okee
chobee, I cross the hummockland or through pleasant 
openings or dense forests,
I see the parrots in the woods, I see the papawtree and the blos
soming titi;
Again, sailing in my coaster on deck, I coast off Georgia, I coast 
up the Carolinas,
I see where the liveoak is growing, I see where the yellowpine,
the scented baytree, the lemon and orange, the cypress,
the graceful palmetto,
I pass rude seaheadlands and enter Pamlico sound through an 
inlet, and dart my vision inland;
O the cotton plant! the growing fields of rice, sugar, hemp!
The cactus guarded with thorns, the laureltree with large white 
flowers,
The range afar, the richness and barrenness, the old woods 
charged with mistletoe and trailing moss,
The piney odor and the gloom, the awful natural stillness, (here 
in these dense swamps the freebooter carries his gun, and 
the fugitive has his conceal'd hut;)
O the strange fascination of these halfknown halfimpassable 
swamps, infested by reptiles, resounding with the bellow 
of the alligator, the sad noises of the nightowl and the 
wildcat, and the whirr of the rattlesnake,
The mockingbird, the American mimic, singing all the forenoon,
singing through the moonlit night,
The hummingbird, the wild turkey, the raccoon, the opossum;
A Kentucky cornfield, the tall, graceful, longleav'd corn, slender,
flapping, bright green, with tassels, with beautiful ears each 
wellsheath'd in its husk;
O my heart! O tender and fierce pangs, I can stand them not, I 
will depart;
O to be a Virginian where I grew up! O to be a Carolinian!
O longings irrepressible! O I will go back to old Tennessee and 
never wander more.


MANNAHATTA.

I WAS asking for something specific and perfect for my city,
Whereupon lo! upsprang the aboriginal name.

Now I see what there is in a name, a word, liquid, sane, unruly,
musical, selfsufficient,


                                      



I see that the word of my city is that word from of old,
Because I see that word nested in nests of waterbays, superb,
Rich, hemm'd thick all around with sailships and steamships, an 
island sixteen miles long, solidfounded,
Numberless crowded streets, high growths of iron, slender, strong,
light, splendidly uprising toward clear skies,
Tides swift and ample, wellloved by me, toward sundown,
The flowing seacurrents, the little islands, larger adjoining islands,
the heights, the villas,
The countless masts, the white shoresteamers, the lighters, the 
ferryboats, the black seasteamers wellmodel'd,
The downtown streets, the jobbers' houses of business, the houses 
of business of the shipmerchants and moneybrokers, the 
riverstreets,
Immigrants arriving, fifteen or twenty thousand in a week,
The carts hauling goods, the manly race of drivers of horses, the 
brownfaced sailors,
The summer air, the bright sun shining, and the sailing clouds 
aloft,
The winter snows, the sleighbells, the broken ice in the river,
passing along up or down with the floodtide or ebbtide,
The mechanics of the city, the masters, wellform'd, beautiful
faced, looking you straight in the eyes,
Trottoirs throng'd, vehicles, Broadway, the women, the shops and 
shows,
A million people—manners free and superb—open voices—
hospitality—the most courageous and friendly young men,
City of hurried and sparkling waters! city of spires and masts!
City nested in bays! my city!


ALL IS TRUTH.

O ME, man of slack faith so long,
Standing aloof, denying portions so long,
Only aware today of compact alldiffused truth,
Discovering today there is no lie or form of lie, and can be none,
but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon 
itself,
Or as any law of the earth or any natural production of the earth 
does.

(This is curious and may not be realized immediately, but it must 
be realized,
I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally with the rest,
And that the universe does.)



                                      



Where has fail'd a perfect return indifferent of lies or the truth?
Is it upon the ground, or in water or fire? or in the spirit of man?
or in the meat and blood?

Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself, I see 
that there are really no liars or lies after all,
And that nothing fails its perfect return, and that what are called 
lies are perfect returns,
And that each thing exactly represents itself and what has pre
ceded it,
And that the truth includes all, and is compact just as much as 
space is compact,
And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truth—
but that all is truth without exception;
And henceforth I will go celebrate any thing I see or am,
And sing and laugh and deny nothing.


A RIDDLE SONG.

THAT which eludes this verse and any verse,
Unheard by sharpest ear, unform'd in clearest eye or cunningest 
mind,
Nor lore nor fame, nor happiness nor wealth,
And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world 
incessantly,
Which you and I and all pursuing ever ever miss,
Open but still a secret, the real of the real, an illusion,
Costless, vouchsafed to each, yet never man the owner,
Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme, historians in prose,
Which sculptor never chisel'd yet, nor painter painted,
Which vocalist never sung, nor orator nor actor ever utter'd,
Invoking here and now I challenge for my song.

Indifferently, 'mid public, private haunts, in solitude,
Behind the mountain and the wood,
Companion of the city's busiest streets, through the assemblage,
It and its radiations constantly glide.

In looks of fair unconscious babes,
Or strangely in the coffin'd dead,
Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night,
As some dissolving delicate film of dreams,
Hiding yet lingering.

Two little breaths of words comprising it,
Two words, yet all from first to last comprised in it.



                                      



How ardently for it!
How many ships have sail'd and sunk for it!
How many travelers started from their homes and ne'er return'd!
How much of genius boldly staked and lost for it!
What countless stores of beauty, love, ventur'd for it!
How all superbest deeds since Time began are traceable to it—
and shall be to the end!
How all heroic martyrdoms to it!
How, justified by it, the horrors, evils, battles of the earth!
How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it, in every age and 
land, have drawn men's eyes,
Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast, the sky, the islands, and the 
cliffs,
Or midnight's silent glowing northern lights unreachable.

Haply God's riddle it, so vague and yet so certain,
The soul for it, and all the visible universe for it,
And heaven at last for it.


EXCELSIOR.

WHO has gone farthest? for I would go farther,
And who has been just? for I would be the most just person of 
the earth,
And who most cautious? for I would be more cautious,
And who has been happiest? O I think it is I—I think no one 
was ever happier than I,
And who has lavish'd all? for I lavish constantly the best I have,
And who proudest? for I think I have reason to be the proudest 
son alive—for I am the son of the brawny and talltopt 
city,
And who has been bold and true? for I would be the boldest and 
truest being of the universe,
And who benevolent? for I would show more benevolence than 
all the rest,
And who has receiv'd the love of the most friends? for I know 
what it is to receive the passionate love of many friends,
And who possesses a perfect and enamour'd body? for I do not 
believe any one possesses a more perfect or enamour'd 
body than mine,
And who thinks the amplest thoughts? for I would surround those 
thoughts,
And who has made hymns fit for the earth? for I am mad with de
vouring ecstasy to make joyous hymns for the whole earth.



                                      




AH POVERTIES, WINCINGS, AND SULKY RETREATS.

AH poverties, wincings, and sulky retreats,
Ah you foes that in conflict have overcome me,
(For what is my life or any man's life but a conflict with foes, the 
old, the incessant war?)
You degradations, you tussle with passions and appetites,
You smarts from dissatisfied friendships, (ah wounds the sharpest 
of all!)
You toil of painful and choked articulations, you meannesses,
You shallow tonguetalks at tables, (my tongue the shallowest of 
any;)
You broken resolutions, you racking angers, you smother'd ennuis!
Ah think not you finally triumph, my real self has yet to come 
forth,
It shall yet march forth o'ermastering, till all lies beneath me,
It shall yet stand up the soldier of ultimate victory.


THOUGHTS.

OF public opinion,
Of a calm and cool fiat sooner or later, (how impassive! how 
certain and final!)
Of the President with pale face asking secretly to himself, What 
will the people say at last?
Of the frivolous Judge—of the corrupt Congressman, Governor,
Mayor—of such as these standing helpless and exposed,
Of the mumbling and screaming priest, (soon, soon deserted,)
Of the lessening year by year of venerableness, and of the dicta 
of officers, statutes, pulpits, schools,
Of the rising forever taller and stronger and broader of the intui
tions of men and women, and of Selfesteem and Per
sonality;
Of the true New World—of the Democracies resplendent en
masse,
Of the conformity of politics, armies, navies, to them,
Of the shining sun by them—of the inherent light, greater than 
the rest,
Of the envelopment of all by them, and the effusion of all from 
them.


MEDIUMS.

THEY shall arise in the States,
They shall report Nature, laws, physiology, and happiness,
They shall illustrate Democracy and the kosmos,


                                      



They shall be alimentive, amative, perceptive,
They shall be complete women and men, their pose brawny and 
supple, their drink water, their blood clean and clear,
They shall fully enjoy materialism and the sight of products, they 
shall enjoy the sight of the beef, lumber, breadstuffs, of 
Chicago the great city,
They shall train themselves to go in public to become orators and 
oratresses,
Strong and sweet shall their tongues be, poems and materials of 
poems shall come from their lives, they shall be makers 
and finders,
Of them and of their works shall emerge divine conveyers, to 
convey gospels,
Characters, events, retrospections, shall be convey'd in gospels,
trees, animals, waters, shall be convey'd,
Death, the future, the invisible faith, shall all be convey'd.


WEAVE IN, MY HARDY LIFE.

WEAVE in, weave in, my hardy life,
Weave yet a soldier strong and full for great campaigns to come,
Weave in red blood, weave sinews in like ropes, the senses, sight 
weave in,
Weave lasting sure, weave day and night the weft, the warp,
incessant weave, tire not,
(We know not what the use O life, nor know the aim, the end,
nor really aught we know,
But know the work, the need goes on and shall go on, the death
envelop'd march of peace as well as war goes on,)
For great campaigns of peace the same the wiry threads to weave,
We know not why or what, yet weave, forever weave.


SPAIN, 

OUT of the murk of heaviest clouds,
Out of the feudal wrecks and heap'dup skeletons of kings,
Out of that old entire European debris, the shatter'd mummeries,
Ruin'd cathedrals, crumble of palaces, tombs of priests,
Lo, Freedom's features fresh undimm'd look forth—the same 
immortal face looks forth;
(A glimpse as of thy Mother's face Columbia,
A flash significant as of a sword,
Beaming towards thee.)



                                      



Nor think we forget thee maternal;
Lag'd'st thou so long? shall the clouds close again upon thee?
Ah, but thou hast thyself now appear'd to us—we know thee,
Thou hast given us a sure proof, the glimpse of thyself,
Thou waitest there as everywhere thy time.


BY BROAD POTOMAC'S SHORE.

BY broad Potomac's shore, again old tongue,
(Still uttering, still ejaculating, canst never cease this babble?)
Again old heart so gay, again to you, your sense, the full flush 
spring returning,
Again the freshness and the odors, again Virginia's summer sky,
pellucid blue and silver,
Again the forenoon purple of the hills,
Again the deathless grass, so noiseless soft and green,
Again the bloodred roses blooming.

Perfume this book of mine O bloodred roses!
Lave subtly with your waters every line Potomac!
Give me of you O spring, before I close, to put between its 
pages!
O forenoon purple of the hills, before I close, of you!
O deathless grass, of you!


FROM FAR DAKOTA'S CAÑONS.
June , .

FROM far Dakota's cañons,
Lands of the wild ravine, the dusky Sioux, the lonesome stretch,
the silence,
Haply today a mournful wail, haply a trumpetnote for heroes.

The battlebulletin,
The Indian ambuscade, the craft, the fatal environment,
The cavalry companies fighting to the last in sternest heroism,
In the midst of their little circle, with their slaughter'd horses for 
breastworks,
The fall of Custer and all his officers and men.

Continues yet the old, old legend of our race,
The loftiest of life upheld by death,
The ancient banner perfectly maintain'd,
O lesson opportune, O how I welcome thee!



                                      



As sitting in dark days,
Lone, sulky, through the time's thick murk looking in vain for light,
for hope,
From unsuspected parts a fierce and momentary proof,
(The sun there at the centre though conceal'd,
Electric life forever at the centre,)
Breaks forth a lightning flash.

Thou of the tawny flowing hair in battle,
I erewhile saw, with erect head, pressing ever in front, bearing a 
bright sword in thy hand,
Now ending well in death the splendid fever of thy deeds,
(I bring no dirge for it or thee, I bring a glad triumphal sonnet,)
Desperate and glorious, aye in defeat most desperate, most glorious,
After thy many battles in which never yielding up a gun or a color,
Leaving behind thee a memory sweet to soldiers,
Thou yieldest up thyself.


OLD WARDREAMS.

IN midnight sleep of many a face of anguish,
Of the look at first of the mortally wounded, (of that indescribable 
look,)
Of the dead on their backs with arms extended wide,
I dream, I dream, I dream.

Of scenes of Nature, fields and mountains,
Of skies so beauteous after a storm, and at night the moon so 
unearthly bright,
Shining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches and 
gather the heaps,
I dream, I dream, I dream.

Long have they pass'd, faces and trenches and fields,
Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure,
or away from the fallen,
Onward I sped at the time—but now of their forms at night,
I dream, I dream, I dream.


THICKSPRINKLED BUNTING.

THICKSPRINKLED bunting! flag of stars!
Long yet your road, fateful flag—long yet your road, and lined 
with bloody death,



                                      



For the prize I see at issue at last is the world,
All its ships and shores I see interwoven with your threads greedy 
banner;
Dream'd again the flags of kings, highest borne, to flaunt unrival'd?
O hasten flag of man—O with sure and steady step, passing 
highest flags of kings,
Walk supreme to the heavens mighty symbol—run up above 
them all,
Flag of stars! thicksprinkled bunting!


WHAT BEST I SEE IN THEE.
To U. S. G. return'd from his World's Tour.

WHAT best I see in thee,
Is not that where thou mov'st down history's great highways,
Ever undimm'd by time shoots warlike victory's dazzle,
Or that thou sat'st where Washington sat, ruling the land in peace,
Or thou the man whom feudal Europe feted, venerable Asia 
swarm'd upon,
Who walk'd with kings with even pace the round world's prome
nade;
But that in foreign lands, in all thy walks with kings,
Those prairie sovereigns of the West, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,
Ohio's, Indiana's millions, comrades, farmers, soldiers, all to the 
front,
Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round 
world's promenade,
Were all so justified.


SPIRIT THAT FORM'D THIS SCENE.
Written in Platte Cañon, Colorado.

SPIRIT that form'd this scene,
These tumbled rockpiles grim and red,
These reckless heavenambitious peaks,
These gorges, turbulentclear streams, this naked freshness,
These formless wild arrays, for reasons of their own,
I know thee, savage spirit—we have communed together,
Mine too such wild arrays, for reasons of their own;
Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten art?
To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delicatesse?
The lyrist's measur'd beat, the wroughtout temple's grace—
column and polish'd arch forgot?
But thou that revelest here—spirit that form'd this scene,
They have remember'd thee.



                                      




AS I WALK THESE BROAD MAJESTIC DAYS.

AS I walk these broad majestic days of peace,
(For the war, the struggle of blood finish'd, wherein, O terrific 
Ideal,
Against vast odds erewhile having gloriously won,
Now thou stridest on, yet perhaps in time toward denser wars,
Perhaps to engage in time in still more dreadful contests, dangers,
Longer campaigns and crises, labors beyond all others,)
Around me I hear that eclat of the world, politics, produce,
The announcements of recognized things, science,
The approved growth of cities and the spread of inventions.

I see the ships, (they will last a few years,)
The vast factories with their foremen and workmen,
And hear the indorsement of all, and do not object to it.

But I too announce solid things,
Science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not nothing,
Like a grand procession to music of distant bugles pouring,
triumphantly moving, and grander heaving in sight,
They stand for realities—all is as it should be.

Then my realities;
What else is so real as mine?
Libertad and the divine average, freedom to every slave on the 
face of the earth,
The rapt promises and luminè of seers, the spiritual world, these 
centurieslasting songs,
And our visions, the visions of poets, the most solid announce
ments of any.


A CLEAR MIDNIGHT.

THIS is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,
Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,
Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes 
thou lovest best,
Night, sleep, death and the stars.


                                      




SONGS OF PARTING.



—————


AS THE TIME DRAWS NIGH.

AS the time draws nigh glooming a cloud,
A dread beyond of I know not what darkens me.

I shall go forth,
I shall traverse the States awhile, but I cannot tell whither or how 
long,
Perhaps soon some day or night while I am singing my voice will 
suddenly cease.

O book, O chants! must all then amount to but this?
Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us?—and yet it is 
enough, O soul;
O soul, we have positively appear'd—that is enough.


YEARS OF THE MODERN.

YEARS of the modern! years of the unperform'd!
Your horizon rises, I see it parting away for more august dramas,
I see not America only, not only Liberty's nation but other nations 
preparing,
I see tremendous entrances and exits, new combinations, the soli
darity of races,
I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world's 
stage,
(Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the 
acts suitable to them closed?)
I see Freedom, completely arm'd and victorious and very haughty,
with Law on one side and Peace on the other,
A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste;
What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?
I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions,
I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken,
I see the landmarks of European kings removed,
I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, (all others 
give way;)
Never were such sharp questions ask'd as this day,
Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a God,


                                      



Lo, how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest!
His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere, he colonizes the 
Pacific, the archipelagoes,
With the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the 
wholesale engines of war,
With these and the worldspreading factories he interlinks all 
geography, all lands;
What whispers are these O lands, running ahead of you, passing 
under the seas?
Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to 
the globe?
Is humanity forming enmasse? for lo, tyrants tremble, crowns 
grow dim,
The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war,
No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the days 
and nights;
Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to 
pierce it, is full of phantoms,
Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me,
This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of dreams 
O years!
Your dreams O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know 
not whether I sleep or wake;)
The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow 
behind me,
The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon 
me.


ASHES OF SOLDIERS.

ASHES of soldiers South or North,
As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought,
The war resumes, again to my sense your shapes,
And again the advance of the armies.

Noiseless as mists and vapors,
From their graves in the trenches ascending,
From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee,
From every point of the compass out of the countless graves,
In wafted clouds, in myriads large, or squads of twos or threes or 
single ones they come,
And silently gather round me.

Now sound no note O trumpeters,
Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses,


                                      



With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by their thighs, (ah 
my brave horsemen!
My handsome tanfaced horsemen! what life, what joy and pride,
With all the perils were yours.)

Nor you drummers, neither at reveillé at dawn,
Nor the long roll alarming the camp, nor even the muffled beat 
for a burial,
Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlike drums.

But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded 
promenade,
Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and 
voiceless,
The slain elate and alive again, the dust and debris alive,
I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead 
soldiers.

Faces so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet,
Draw close, but speak not.

Phantoms of countless lost,
Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions,
Follow me ever—desert me not while I live.

Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living—sweet are the musi
cal voices sounding,
But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead with their silent eyes.

Dearest comrades, all is over and long gone,
But love is not over—and what love, O comrades!
Perfume from battlefields rising, up from the foetor arising.

Perfume therefore my chant, O love, immortal love,
Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers,
Shroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender pride.

Perfume all—make all wholesome,
Make these ashes to nourish and blossom,
O love, solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry.

Give me exhaustless, make me a fountain,
That I exhale love from me wherever I go like a moist perennial 
dew,
For the ashes of all dead soldiers South or North.



                                      




THOUGHTS.



OF these years I sing,
How they pass and have pass'd through convuls'd pains, as through 
parturitions,
How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the promise, the 
sure fulfilment, the absolute success, despite of people— 
illustrates evil as well as good,
The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one'sself;
How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, 
myths, obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity,
How few see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western States, 
or see freedom or spirituality, or hold any faith in results,
(But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious 
and inevitable, and they again leading to other results.)

How the great cities appear—how the Democratic masses, turbu
lent, wilful, as I love them,
How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the 
sounding and resounding, keep on and on,
How society waits unform'd, and is for a while between things 
ended and things begun,
How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of 
freedom and of the Democracies, and of the fruits of so
ciety, and of all that is begun,
And how the States are complete in themselves—and how all 
triumphs and glories are complete in themselves, to lead 
onward,
And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be con
vuls'd, and serve other parturitions and transitions,
And how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic masses 
too, serve—and how every fact, and war itself, with all its 
horrors, serves,
And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition 
of death.




Of seeds dropping into the ground, of births,
Of the steady concentration of America, inland, upward, to im
pregnable and swarming places,
Of what Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, and the rest, are to be,
Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska, Colorado, 
Nevada, and the rest,
(Or afar, mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska,)


                                      



Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for—and of 
what all sights, North, South, East and West, are,
Of this Union welded in blood, of the solemn price paid, of the 
unnamed lost ever present in my mind;
Of the temporary use of materials for identity's sake,
Of the present, passing, departing—of the growth of completer 
men than any yet,
Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother, 
the Mississippi flows,
Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey'd and unsuspected,
Of the new and good names, of the modern developments, of 
inalienable homesteads,
Of a free and original life there, of simple diet and clean and 
sweet blood,
Of litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes, and perfect physique there,
Of immense spiritual results future years far West, each side of the 
Anahuacs,
Of these songs, well understood there, (being made for that area,)
Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there,
(O it lurks in me night and day—what is gain after all to savage
ness and freedom?)



SONG AT SUNSET.

SPLENDOR of ended day floating and filling me,
Hour prophetic, hour resuming the past,
Inflating my throat, you divine average,
You earth and life till the last ray gleams I sing.

Open mouth of my soul uttering gladness,
Eyes of my soul seeing perfection,
Natural life of me faithfully praising things,
Corroborating forever the triumph of things.

Illustrious every one!
Illustrious what we name space, sphere of unnumber'd spirits,
Illustrious the mystery of motion in all beings, even the tiniest 
insect,
Illustrious the attribute of speech, the senses, the body,
Illustrious the passing light—illustrious the pale reflection on the 
new moon in the western sky,
Illustrious whatever I see or hear or touch, to the last.

Good in all,
In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals,


                                      



In the annual return of the seasons,
In the hilarity of youth,
In the strength and flush of manhood,
In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,
In the superb vistas of death.

Wonderful to depart!
Wonderful to be here!
The heart, to jet the allalike and innocent blood!
To breathe the air, how delicious!
To speak—to walk—to seize something by the hand!
To prepare for sleep, for bed, to look on my rosecolor'd flesh!
To be conscious of my body, so satisfied, so large!
To be this incredible God I am!
To have gone forth among other Gods, these men and women I 
love.

Wonderful how I celebrate you and myself!
How my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around!
How the clouds pass silently overhead!
How the earth darts on and on! and how the sun, moon, stars,
dart on and on!
How the water sports and sings! (surely it is alive!)
How the trees rise and stand up, with strong trunks, with branches 
and leaves!
(Surely there is something more in each of the trees, some living 
soul.)

O amazement of things—even the least particle!
O spirituality of things!
O strain musical flowing through ages and continents, now reaching 
me and America!
I take your strong chords, intersperse them, and cheerfully pass 
them forward.

I too carol the sun, usher'd or at noon, or as now, setting,
I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all the 
growths of the earth,
I too have felt the resistless call of myself.

As I steam'd down the Mississippi,
As I wander'd over the prairies,
As I have lived, as I have look'd through my windows my eyes,
As I went forth in the morning, as I beheld the light breaking in 
the east,


                                      



As I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea, and again on the 
beach of the Western Sea,
As I roam'd the streets of inland Chicago, whatever streets I have 
roam'd,
Or cities or silent woods, or even amid the sights of war,
Wherever I have been I have charged myself with contentment 
and triumph.

I sing to the last the equalities modern or old,
I sing the endless finalés of things,
I say Nature continues, glory continues,
I praise with electric voice,
For I do not see one imperfection in the universe,
And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the 
universe.

O setting sun! though the time has come,
I still warble under you, if none else does, unmitigated adoration.


AS AT THY PORTALS ALSO DEATH.

AS at thy portals also death,
Entering thy sovereign, dim, illimitable grounds,
To memories of my mother, to the divine blending, maternity,
To her, buried and gone, yet buried not, gone not from me,
(I see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still,
I sit by the form in the coffin,
I kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips, the cheeks,
the closed eyes in the coffin;)
To her, the ideal woman, practical, spiritual, of all of earth, life,
love, to me the best,
I grave a monumental line, before I go, amid these songs,
And set a tombstone here.


MY LEGACY.

THE business man the acquirer vast,
After assiduous years surveying results, preparing for departure,
Devises houses and lands to his children, bequeaths stocks, goods,
funds for a school or hospital,
Leaves money to certain companions to buy tokens, souvenirs of 
gems and gold.

But I, my life surveying, closing,


                                      



With nothing to show to devise from its idle years,
Nor houses nor lands, nor tokens of gems or gold for my friends,
Yet certain remembrances of the war for you, and after you,
And little souvenirs of camps and soldiers, with my love,
I bind together and bequeath in this bundle of songs.


PENSIVE ON HER DEAD GAZING.

PENSIVE on her dead gazing I heard the Mother of All,
Desperate on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battle
fields gazing,
(As the last gun ceased, but the scent of the powdersmoke 
linger'd,)
As she call'd to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk'd,
Absorb them well O my earth, she cried, I charge you lose not 
my sons, lose not an atom,
And you streams absorb them well, taking their dear blood,
And you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly 
impalpable,
And all you essences of soil and growth, and you my rivers' depths,
And you mountain sides, and the woods where my dear children's 
blood trickling redden'd,
And you trees down in your roots to bequeath to all future trees,
My dead absorb or South or North—my young men's bodies 
absorb, and their precious precious blood,
Which holding in trust for me faithfully back again give me many 
a year hence,
In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass, centuries hence,
In blowing airs from the fields back again give me my darlings,
give my immortal heroes,
Exhale me them centuries hence, breathe me their breath, let not 
an atom be lost,
O years and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an aroma sweet!
Exhale them perennial sweet death, years, centuries hence.


CAMPS OF GREEN.

NOT alone those camps of white, old comrades of the wars,
When as order'd forward, after a long march,
Footsore and weary, soon as the light lessens we halt for the night,
Some of us so fatigued carrying the gun and knapsack, dropping 
asleep in our tracks,
Others pitching the little tents, and the fires lit up begin to 
sparkle,


                                      



Outposts of pickets posted surrounding alert through the dark,
And a word provided for countersign, careful for safety,
Till to the call of the drummers at daybreak loudly beating the 
drums,
We rise up refresh'd, the night and sleep pass'd over, and resume 
our journey,
Or proceed to battle.

Lo, the camps of the tents of green,
Which the days of peace keep filling, and the days of war keep 
filling,
With a mystic army, (is it too order'd forward? is it too only halt 
ing awhile,
Till night and sleep pass over?)

Now in those camps of green, in their tents dotting the world,
In the parents, children, husbands, wives, in them, in the old and 
young,
Sleeping under the sunlight, sleeping under the moonlight, content 
and silent there at last,
Behold the mighty bivouacfield and waitingcamp of all,
Of the corps and generals all, and the President over the corps 
and generals all,
And of each of us O soldiers, and of each and all in the ranks we 
fought,
(There without hatred we all, all meet.)

For presently O soldiers, we too camp in our place in the bivouac
camps of green,
But we need not provide for outposts, nor word for the counter
sign,
Nor drummer to beat the morning drum.


THE SOBBING OF THE BELLS.
(Midnight, Sept. , .)

THE sobbing of the bells, the sudden deathnews everywhere,
The slumberers rouse, the rapport of the People,
(Full well they know that message in the darkness,
Full well return, respond within their breasts, their brains, the sad 
reverberations,)
The passionate toll and clang—city to city, joining, sounding,
passing,
Those heartbeats of a Nation in the night.



                                      




AS THEY DRAW TO A CLOSE.

AS they draw to a close,
Of what underlies the precedent songs—of my aims in them,
Of the seed I have sought to plant in them,
Of joy, sweet joy, through many a year, in them,
(For them, for them have I lived, in them my work is done,)
Of many an aspiration fond, of many a dream and plan;
Through Space and Time fused in a chant, and the flowing eternal 
identity,
To Nature encompassing these, encompassing God—to the joy
ous, electric all,
To the sense of Death, and accepting exulting in Death in its 
turn the same as life,
The entrance of man to sing;
To compact you, ye parted, diverse lives,
To put rapport the mountains and rocks and streams,
And the winds of the north, and the forests of oak and pine,
With you O soul.


JOY, SHIPMATE, JOY!

JOY, shipmate, joy!
(Pleas'd to my soul at death I cry,)
Our life is closed, our life begins,
The long, long anchorage we leave,
The ship is clear at last, she leaps!
She swiftly courses from the shore,
Joy, shipmate, joy.


THE UNTOLD WANT.

THE untold want by life and land ne'er granted,
Now voyager sail thou forth to seek and find.


PORTALS.

WHAT are those of the known but to ascend and enter the 
Unknown?
And what are those of life but for Death?


THESE CAROLS.

THESE carols sung to cheer my passage through the world I see,
For completion I dedicate to the Invisible World.



                                      




NOW FINALÈ TO THE SHORE.

NOW finalè to the shore,
Now land and life finalè and farewell,
Now Voyager depart, (much, much for thee is yet in store,)
Often enough hast thou adventur'd o'er the seas,
Cautiously cruising, studying the charts,
Duly again to port and hawser's tie returning;
But now obey thy cherish'd secret wish,
Embrace thy friends, leave all in order,
To port and hawser's tie no more returning,
Depart upon thy endless cruise old Sailor.


SO LONG!

TO conclude, I announce what comes after me.

I remember I said before my leaves sprang at all,
I would raise my voice jocund and strong with reference to con
summations.

When America does what was promis'd,
When through these States walk a hundred millions of superb 
persons,
When the rest part away for superb persons and contribute to them,
When breeds of the most perfect mothers denote America,
Then to me and mine our due fruition.

I have press'd through in my own right,
I have sung the body and the soul, war and peace have I sung,
and the songs of life and death,
And the songs of birth, and shown that there are many births.

I have offer'd my style to every one, I have journey'd with confi
dent step;
While my pleasure is yet at the full I whisper So long!
And take the young woman's hand and the young man's hand for 
the last time.

I announce natural persons to arise,
I announce justice triumphant,
I announce uncompromising liberty and equality,
I announce the justification of candor and the justification of 
pride.



                                      



I announce that the identity of these States is a single identity 
only,
I announce the Union more and more compact, indissoluble,
I announce splendors and majesties to make all the previous poli
tics of the earth insignificant.

I announce adhesiveness, I say it shall be limitless, unloosen'd,
I say you shall yet find the friend you were looking for.

I announce a man or woman coming, perhaps you are the one,
(So long!)
I announce the great individual, fluid as Nature, chaste, affection
ate, compassionate, fully arm'd.

I announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual, bold,
I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its transla
tion.

I announce myriads of youths, beautiful, gigantic, sweetblooded,
I announce a race of splendid and savage old men.

O thicker and faster—(So long!)
O crowding too close upon me,
I foresee too much, it means more than I thought,
It appears to me I am dying.

Hasten throat and sound your last,
Salute me—salute the days once more. Peal the old cry once 
more.

Screaming electric, the atmosphere using,
At random glancing, each as I notice absorbing,
Swiftly on, but a little while alighting,
Curious envelop'd messages delivering,
Sparkles hot, seed ethereal down in the dirt dropping,
Myself unknowing, my commission obeying, to question it never 
daring,
To ages and ages yet the growth of the seed leaving,
To troops out of the war arising, they the tasks I have set promul
ging,
To women certain whispers of myself bequeathing, their affection 
me more clearly explaining,
To young men my problems offering—no dallier I—I the mus 
cle of their brains trying,
So I pass, a little time vocal, visible, contrary,


                                      



Afterward a melodious echo, passionately bent for, (death making 
me really undying,)
The best of me then when no longer visible, for toward that I have 
been incessantly preparing.

What is there more, that I lag and pause and crouch extended 
with unshut mouth?
Is there a single final farewell?

My songs cease, I abandon them,
From behind the screen where I hid I advance personally solely 
to you.

Camerado, this is no book,
Who touches this touches a man,
(Is it night? are we here together alone?)
It is I you hold and who holds you,
I spring from the pages into your arms—decease calls me forth.

O how your fingers drowse me,
Your breath falls around me like dew, your pulse lulls the tympans 
of my ears,
I feel immerged from head to foot,
Delicious, enough.

Enough O deed impromptu and secret,
Enough O gliding present—enough O summ'dup past.

Dear friend whoever you are take this kiss,
I give it especially to you, do not forget me,
I feel like one who has done work for the day to retire awhile,
I receive now again of my many translations, from my avataras as
cending, while others doubtless await me,
An unknown sphere more real than I dream'd, more direct, darts 
awakening rays about me, So long!
Remember my words, I may again return,
I love you, I depart from materials,
I am as one disembodied, triumphant, dead.


                                      


SANDS AT SEVENTY

MANNAHATTA.

My city's fit and noble name resumed,
Choice aboriginal name, with marvellous beauty, meaning,
A rocky founded island—shores where ever gayly dash the coming, 
going, hurrying sea waves.


PAUMANOK.

Seabeauty! stretch'd and basking!
One side thy inland ocean laving, broad, with copious commerce, 
steamers, sails,
And one the Atlantic's wind caressing, fierce or gentle—mighty 
hulls darkgliding in the distance.
Isle of sweet brooks of drinkingwater—healthy air and soil!
Isle of the salty shore and breeze and brine!


FROM MONTAUK POINT.

I stand as on some mighty eagle's beak,
Eastward the sea absorbing, viewing, (nothing but sea and sky,)
The tossing waves, the foam, the ships in the distance,
The wild unrest, the snowy, curling caps—that inbound urge 
and urge of waves,
Seeking the shores forever.


TO THOSE WHO'VE FAIL'D.

To those who've fail'd, in aspiration vast,
To unnam'd soldiers fallen in front on the lead,
To calm, devoted engineers—to overardent travelers—to pilots 
on their ships,
To many a lofty song and picture without recognition—I'd rear 
a laurelcover'd monument,
High, high above the rest—To all cut off before their time,
Possess'd by some strange spirit of fire,
Quench'd by an early death.



                                      




A CAROL CLOSING SIXTYNINE.

A carol closing sixtynine—a résumé—a repetition,
My lines in joy and hope continuing on the same,
Of ye, O God, Life, Nature, Freedom, Poetry;
Of you, my Land—your rivers, prairies, States—you, mottled 
Flag I love,
Your aggregate retain'd entire—Of north, south, east and west, 
your items all;
Of me myself—the jocund heart yet beating in my breast,
The body wreck'd, old, poor and paralyzed—the strange inertia 
falling palllike round me,
The burning fires down in my sluggish blood not yet extinct,
The undiminish'd faith—the groups of loving friends.


THE BRAVEST SOLDIERS.

Brave, brave were the soldiers (high named today) who lived 
through the fight;
But the bravest press'd to the front and fell, unnamed, unknown.


A FONT OF TYPE.

This latent mine—these unlaunch'd voices—passionate powers,
Wrath, argument, or praise, or comic leer, or prayer devout,
(Not nonpareil, brevier, bourgeois, long primer merely,)
These ocean waves arousable to fury and to death,
Or sooth'd to ease and sheeny sun and sleep,
Within the pallid slivers slumbering.


AS I SIT WRITING HERE.

As I sit writing here, sick and grown old,
Not my least burden is that dulness of the years, querilities,
Ungracious glooms, aches, lethargy, constipation, whimpering 
ennui,
May filter in my daily songs.


MY CANARY BIRD.

Did we count great, O soul, to penetrate the themes of mighty 
books,
Absorbing deep and full from thoughts, plays, speculations?
But now from thee to me, caged bird, to feel thy joyous warble,
Filling the air, the lonesome room, the long forenoon,
Is it not just as great, O soul?



                                      




QUERIES TO MY SEVENTIETH YEAR.

Approaching, nearing, curious,
Thou dim, uncertain spectre—bringest thou life or death?
Strength, weakness, blindness, more paralysis and heavier?
Or placid skies and sun? Wilt stir the waters yet?
Or haply cut me short for good? Or leave me here as now,
Dull, parrotlike and old, with crack'd voice harping, screeching?


THE WALLABOUT MARTYRS.

In Brooklyn, in an old vault, mark'd by no special recognition, lie huddled at this moment the undoubtedly authentic remains of the stanchest and earliest revolutionary patriots from the British prison ships and prisons of the times of –, in and around New York, and from all over Long Island; originally buried—many thousands of them—in trenches in the Wallabout sands.

Greater than memory of Achilles or Ulysses,
More, more by far to thee than tomb of Alexander,
Those cart loads of old charnel ashes, scales and splints of 
mouldy bones,
Once living men—once resolute courage, aspiration, strength,
The stepping stones to thee today and here, America.


THE FIRST DANDELION.

Simple and fresh and fair from winter's close emerging,
As if no artifice of fashion, business, politics, had ever been,
Forth from its sunny nook of shelter'd grass—innocent, golden, 
calm as the dawn,
The spring's first dandelion shows its trustful face.


AMERICA.

Centre of equal daughters, equal sons,
All, all alike endear'd, grown, ungrown, young or old,
Strong, ample, fair, enduring, capable, rich,
Perennial with the Earth, with Freedom, Law and Love,
A grand, sane, towering, seated Mother,
Chair'd in the adamant of Time.


MEMORIES.

How sweet the silent backward tracings!
The wanderings as in dreams—the meditation of old times re
sumed—their loves, joys, persons, voyages.



                                      




TODAY AND THEE.

The appointed winners in a longstretch'd game;
The course of Time and nations—Egypt, India, Greece and 
Rome;
The past entire, with all its heroes, histories, arts, experiments,
Its store of songs, inventions, voyages, teachers, books,
Garner'd for now and thee—To think of it!
The heirdom all converged in thee!


AFTER THE DAZZLE OF DAY.

After the dazzle of day is gone,
Only the dark, dark night shows to my eyes the stars;
After the clangor of organ majestic, or chorus, or perfect band,
Silent, athwart my soul, moves the symphony true.


ABRAHAM LINCOLN, BORN FEB. , .

Today, from each and all, a breath of prayer—a pulse of 
thought,
To memory of Him—to birth of Him.
Publish'd Feb. , .



OUT OF MAY'S SHOWS SELECTED.

Apple orchards, the trees all cover'd with blossoms;
Wheat fields carpeted far and near in vital emerald green;
The eternal, exhaustless freshness of each early morning;
The yellow, golden, transparent haze of the warm afternoon sun;
The aspiring lilac bushes with profuse purple or white flowers.


HALCYON DAYS.

Not from successful love alone,
Nor wealth, nor honor'd middle age, nor victories of politics or 
war;
But as life wanes, and all the turbulent passions calm,
As gorgeous, vapory, silent hues cover the evening sky,
As softness, fulness, rest, suffuse the frame, like freshier, balmier 
air,
As the days take on a mellower light, and the apple at last hangs 
really finish'd and indolentripe on the tree,
Then for the teeming quietest, happiest days of all!
The brooding and blissful halcyon days!



                                      




FANCIES AT NAVESINK.


THE PILOT IN THE MIST.

Steaming the northern rapids—(an old St. Lawrence reminis
cence,
A sudden memoryflash comes back, I know not why,
Here waiting for the sunrise, gazing from this hill;)*
Again 'tis just at morning—a heavy haze contends with day
break,
Again the trembling, laboring vessel veers me—I press through 
foamdash'd rocks that almost touch me,
Again I mark where aft the small thin Indian helmsman
Looms in the mist, with brow elate and governing hand.


HAD I THE CHOICE.

Had I the choice to tally greatest bards,
To limn their portraits, stately, beautiful, and emulate at will,
Homer with all his wars and warriors—Hector, Achilles, Ajax,
Or Shakspere's woeentangled Hamlet, Lear, Othello—Tenny
son's fair ladies,
Metre or wit the best, or choice conceit to wield in perfect 
rhyme, delight of singers;
These, these, O sea, all these I'd gladly barter,
Would you the undulation of one wave, its trick to me transfer,
Or breathe one breath of yours upon my verse,
And leave its odor there.


YOU TIDES WITH CEASELESS SWELL.

You tides with ceaseless swell! you power that does this work!
You unseen force, centripetal, centrifugal, through space's 
spread,
Rapport of sun, moon, earth, and all the constellations,
What are the messages by you from distant stars to us? what 
Sirius'? what Capella's?
What central heart—and you the pulse—vivifies all? what 
boundless aggregate of all?
What subtle indirection and significance in you? what clue to 
all in you? what fluid, vast identity,
Holding the universe with all its parts as one—as sailing in a ship?

LAST OF EBB, AND DAYLIGHT WANING.

Last of ebb, and daylight waning,
Scented seacool landward making, smells of sedge and salt 
incoming,
With many a halfcaught voice sent up from the eddies,
Many a muffled confession—many a sob and whisper'd word,
As of speakers far or hid.

How they sweep down and out! how they mutter!
Poets unnamed—artists greatest of any, with cherish'd lost 
designs,
Love's unresponse—a chorus of age's complaints—hope's last 
words,
Some suicide's despairing cry, Away to the boundless waste, and 
never again return.

On to oblivion then!
On, on, and do your part, ye burying, ebbing tide!
On for your time, ye furious debouché!


AND YET NOT YOU ALONE.

And yet not you alone, twilight and burying ebb,
Nor you, ye lost designs alone—nor failures, aspirations;
I know, divine deceitful ones, your glamour's seeming;
Duly by you, from you, the tide and light again—duly the 
hinges turning,
Duly the needed discordparts offsetting, blending,
Weaving from you, from Sleep, Night, Death itself,
The rhythmus of Birth eternal.


PROUDLY THE FLOOD COMES IN.

Proudly the flood comes in, shouting, foaming, advancing,
Long it holds at the high, with bosom broad outswelling,
All throbs, dilates—the farms, woods, streets of cities—workmen 
at work,
Mainsails, topsails, jibs, appear in the offing—steamers' pennants 
of smoke—and under the forenoon sun,
Freighted with human lives, gaily the outward bound, gaily the 
inward bound,
Flaunting from many a spar the flag I love.


BY THAT LONG SCAN OF WAVES.

By that long scan of waves, myself call'd back, resumed upon 
myself,
In every crest some undulating light or shade—some retrospect,


                                      



Joys, travels, studies, silent panoramas—scenes ephemeral,
The long past war, the battles, hospital sights, the wounded and 
the dead,
Myself through every bygone phase—my idle youth—old age at 
hand,
My threescore years of life summ'd up, and more, and past,
By any grand ideal tried, intentionless, the whole a nothing,
And haply yet some drop within God's scheme's ensemble—some 
wave, or part of wave,
Like one of yours, ye multitudinous ocean.


THEN LAST OF ALL.

Then last of all, caught from these shores, this hill,
Of you O tides, the mystic human meaning:
Only by law of you, your swell and ebb, enclosing me the same,
The brain that shapes, the voice that chants this song.


ELECTION DAY, NOVEMBER, .

If I should need to name, O Western World, your powerfulest 
scene and show,
'Twould not be you, Niagara—nor you, ye limitless prairies—nor 
your huge rifts of canyons, Colorado,
Nor you, Yosemite—nor Yellowstone, with all its spasmic geyser
loops ascending to the skies, appearing and disappearing,
Nor Oregon's white cones—nor Huron's belt of mighty lakes—
nor Mississippi's stream:
—This seething hemisphere's humanity, as now, I'd name—the 
still small voice vibrating—America's choosing day,
(The heart of it not in the chosen—the act itself the main, the 
quadriennial choosing,)
The stretch of North and South arous'd—seaboard and inland 
—Texas to Maine—the Prairie States—Vermont, Virginia, 
California,
The final ballotshower from East to West—the paradox and con
flict,
The countless snowflakes falling—(a swordless conflict,
Yet more than all Rome's wars of old, or modern Napoleon's:) 
the peaceful choice of all,
Or good or ill humanity—welcoming the darker odds, the dross:
—Foams and ferments the wine? it serves to purify—while the 
heart pants, life glows:
These stormy gusts and winds waft precious ships,
Swell'd Washington's, Jefferson's, Lincoln's sails.



                                      




WITH HUSKYHAUGHTY LIPS, O SEA!

With huskyhaughty lips, O sea!
Where day and night I wend thy surfbeat shore,
Imaging to my sense thy varied strange suggestions,
(I see and plainly list thy talk and conference here,)
Thy troops of whitemaned racers racing to the goal,
Thy ample, smiling face, dash'd with the sparkling dimples of the 
sun,
Thy brooding scowl and murk—thy unloos'd hurricanes,
Thy unsubduedness, caprices, wilfulness;
Great as thou art above the rest, thy many tears—a lack from all 
eternity in thy content,
(Naught but the greatest struggles, wrongs, defeats, could make 
thee greatest—no less could make thee,)
Thy lonely state—something thou ever seek'st and seek'st, yet 
never gain'st,
Surely some right withheld—some voice, in huge monotonous 
rage, of freedomlover pent,
Some vast heart, like a planet's, chain'd and chafing in those 
breakers,
By lengthen'd swell, and spasm, and panting breath,
And rhythmic rasping of thy sands and waves,
And serpent hiss, and savage peals of laughter,
And undertones of distant lion roar,
(Sounding, appealing to the sky's deaf ear—but now, rapport for 
once,
A phantom in the night thy confidant for once,)
The first and last confession of the globe,
Outsurging, muttering from thy soul's abysms,
The tale of cosmic elemental passion,
Thou tellest to a kindred soul.


DEATH OF GENERAL GRANT.

As one by one withdraw the lofty actors,
From that great play on history's stage eterne,
That lurid, partial act of war and peace—of old and new con
tending,
Fought out through wrath, fears, dark dismays, and many a long 
suspense;
All past—and since, in countless graves receding, mellowing,
Victor's and vanquish'd—Lincoln's and Lee's—now thou with 
them,


                                      



Man of the mighty days—and equal to the days!
Thou from the prairies!—tangled and manyvein'd and hard has 
been thy part,
To admiration has it been enacted!


RED JACKET (FROM ALOFT.)

Impromptu on Buffalo City's monument to, and reburial of the old Iroquois orator, October , .

Upon this scene, this show,
Yielded today by fashion, learning, wealth,
(Nor in caprice alone—some grains of deepest meaning,)
Haply, aloft, (who knows?) from distant skyclouds' blended 
shapes,
As some old tree, or rock or cliff, thrill'd with its soul,
Product of Nature's sun, stars, earth direct—a towering human 
form,
In huntingshirt of film, arm'd with the rifle, a halfironical smile 
curving its phantom lips,
Like one of Ossian's ghosts looks down.


WASHINGTON'S MONUMENT, FEBRUARY, .

Ah, not this marble, dead and cold:
Far from its base and shaft expanding—the round zones circling, 
comprehending,
Thou, Washington, art all the world's, the continents' entire—
not yours alone, America,
Europe's as well, in every part, castle of lord or laborer's cot,
Or frozen North, or sultry South—the African's—the Arab's in 
his tent,
Old Asia's there with venerable smile, seated amid her ruins;
(Greets the antique the hero new? 'tis but the same—the heir 
legitimate, continued ever,
The indomitable heart and arm—proofs of the neverbroken 
line,
Courage, alertness, patience, faith, the same—e'en in defeat de
feated not, the same:)
Wherever sails a ship, or house is built on land, or day or night,
Through teeming cities' streets, indoors or out, factories or farms,
Now, or to come, or past—where patriot wills existed or exist,
Wherever Freedom, pois'd by Toleration, sway'd by Law,
Stands or is rising thy true monument.



                                      




OF THAT BLITHE THROAT OF THINE.

More than eightythree degrees north—about a good day's steaming distance to the Pole by one of our fast oceaners in clear water—Greely the explorer heard the 
song of a single snowbird merrily sounding over the desolation.

Of that blithe throat of thine from arctic bleak and blank,
I'll mind the lesson, solitary bird—let me too welcome chilling 
drifts,
E'en the profoundest chill, as now—a torpid pulse, a brain un
nerv'd,
Old age landlock'd within its winter bay—(cold, cold, O cold!)
These snowy hairs, my feeble arm, my frozen feet,
For them thy faith, thy rule I take, and grave it to the last;
Not summer's zones alone—not chants of youth, or south's warm 
tides alone,
But held by sluggish floes, pack'd in the northern ice, the cumulus 
of years,
These with gay heart I also sing.


BROADWAY.

What hurrying human tides, or day or night!
What passions, winnings, losses, ardors, swim thy waters!
What whirls of evil, bliss and sorrow, stem thee!
What curious questioning glances—glints of love!
Leer, envy, scorn, contempt, hope, aspiration!
Thou portal—thou arena—thou of the myriad longdrawn lines 
and groups!
(Could but thy flagstones, curbs, façades, tell their inimitable 
tales;
Thy windows rich, and huge hotels—thy sidewalks wide;)
Thou of the endless sliding, mincing, shuffling feet!
Thou, like the particolored world itself—like infinite, teeming, 
mocking life!
Thou visor'd, vast, unspeakable show and lesson!


TO GET THE FINAL LILT OF SONGS.

To get the final lilt of songs,
To penetrate the inmost lore of poets—to know the mighty ones,
Job, Homer, Eschylus, Dante, Shakspere, Tennyson, Emerson;
To diagnose the shiftingdelicate tints of love and pride and 
doubt—to truly understand,
To encompass these, the last keen faculty and entranceprice,
Old age, and what it brings from all its past experiences.



                                      




OLD SALT KOSSABONE.

Far back, related on my mother's side,
Old Salt Kossabone, I'll tell you how he died:
(Had been a sailor all his life—was nearly —lived with his 
married grandchild, Jenny;
House on a hill, with view of bay at hand, and distant cape, and 
stretch to open sea;)
The last of afternoons, the evening hours, for many a year his 
regular custom,
In his great arm chair by the window seated,
(Sometimes, indeed, through half the day,)
Watching the coming, going of the vessels, he mutters to himself 
—And now the close of all:
One struggling outbound brig, one day, baffled for long—cross
tides and much wrong going,
At last at nightfall strikes the breeze aright, her whole luck veer
ing,
And swiftly bending round the cape, the darkness proudly enter
ing, cleaving, as he watches,
"She's free—she's on her destination"—these the last words—
when Jenny came, he sat there dead,
Dutch Kossabone, Old Salt, related on my mother's side, far 
back.


THE DEAD TENOR.

As down the stage again,
With Spanish hat and plumes, and gait inimitable,
Back from the fading lessons of the past, I'd call, I'd tell and 
own,
How much from thee! the revelation of the singing voice from 
thee!
(So firm—so liquidsoft—again that tremulous, manly timbre!
The perfect singing voice—deepest of all to me the lesson—trial 
and test of all:)
How through those strains distill'd—how the rapt ears, the soul 
of me, absorbing
Fernando's heart, Manrico's passionate call, Ernani's, sweet 
Gennaro's,
I fold thenceforth, or seek to fold, within my chants transmuting,
Freedom's and Love's and Faith's unloos'd cantabile,
(As perfume's, color's, sunlight's correlation:)
From these, for these, with these, a hurried line, dead tenor,
A wafted autumn leaf, dropt in the closing grave, the shovel'd 
earth,
To memory of thee.



                                      




CONTINUITIES.

From a talk I had lately with a German spiritualist.

Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost,
No birth, identity, form—no object of the world.
Nor life, nor force, nor any visible thing;
Appearance must not foil, nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain.
Ample are time and space—ample the fields of Nature.
The body, sluggish, aged, cold—the embers left from earlier 
fires,
The light in the eye grown dim, shall duly flame again;
The sun now low in the west rises for mornings and for noons 
continual;
To frozen clods ever the spring's invisible law returns,
With grass and flowers and summer fruits and corn.


YONNONDIO.

The sense of the word is lament for the aborigines. It is an Iroquois term; and has been used for a personal name.

A song, a poem of itself—the word itself a dirge,
Amid the wilds, the rocks, the storm and wintry night,
To me such misty, strange tableaux the syllables calling up;
Yonnondio—I see, far in the west or north, a limitless ravine, 
with plains and mountains dark,
I see swarms of stalwart chieftains, medicinemen, and warriors,
As flitting by like clouds of ghosts, they pass and are gone in the 
twilight,
(Race of the woods, the landscapes free, and the falls!
No picture, poem, statement, passing them to the future:)
Yonnondio! Yonnondio!—unlimn'd they disappear;
Today gives place, and fades—the cities, farms, factories fade;
A muffled sonorous sound, a wailing word is borne through the 
air for a moment,
Then blank and gone and still, and utterly lost.


LIFE.

Ever the undiscouraged, resolute, struggling soul of man;
(Have former armies fail'd? then we send fresh armies—and 
fresh again;)
Ever the grappled mystery of all earth's ages old or new;
Ever the eager eyes, hurrahs, the welcomeclapping hands, the 
loud applause;
Ever the soul dissatisfied, curious, unconvinced at last;
Struggling today the same—battling the same.



                                      




"GOING SOMEWHERE."

My sciencefriend, my noblest womanfriend,
(Now buried in an English grave—and this a memoryleaf for 
her dear sake,)
Ended our talk—"The sum, concluding all we know of old or 
modern learning, intuitions deep,
"Of all Geologies—Histories—of all Astronomy—of Evolution, 
Metaphysics all,
"Is, that we all are onward, onward, speeding slowly, surely 
bettering,
"Life, life an endless march, an endless army, (no halt, but it is 
duly over,)
"The world, the race, the soul—in space and time the universes,
"All bound as is befitting each—all surely going somewhere."

From the  edition L. of G.


SMALL THE THEME OF MY CHANT.

Small the theme of my Chant, yet the greatest—namely, One's
Self—a simple, separate person. That, for the use of the 
New World, I sing.
Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physi
ognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the Muse;—I 
say the Form complete is worthier far. The Female equally 
with the Male, I sing.
Nor cease at the theme of One'sSelf. I speak the word of the 
modern, the word EnMasse.
My Days I sing, and the Lands—with interstice I knew of hap
less War.
(O friend, whoe'er you are, at last arriving hither to commence, 
I feel through every leaf the pressure of your hand, which I 
return.
And thus upon our journey, footing the road, and more than 
once, and link'd together let us go.)


TRUE CONQUERORS.

Old farmers, travelers, workmen (no matter how crippled or 
bent,)
Old sailors, out of many a perilous voyage, storm and wreck,
Old soldiers from campaigns, with all their wounds, defeats and 
scars;
Enough that they've survived at all—long life's unflinching ones!
Forth from their struggles, trials, fights, to have emerged at all 
—in that alone,
True conquerors o'er all the rest.



                                      




THE UNITED STATES TO OLD WORLD CRITICS.

Here first the duties of today, the lessons of the concrete,
Wealth, order, travel, shelter, products, plenty;
As of the building of some varied, vast, perpetual edifice,
Whence to arise inevitable in time, the towering roofs, the lamps,
The solidplanted spires tall shooting to the stars.


THE CALMING THOUGHT OF ALL.

That coursing on, whate'er men's speculations,
Amid the changing schools, theologies, philosophies,
Amid the bawling presentations new and old,
The round earth's silent vital laws, facts, modes continue.


THANKS IN OLD AGE.

Thanks in old age—thanks ere I go,
For health, the midday sun, the impalpable air—for life, mere 
life,
For precious everlingering memories, (of you my mother dear 
—you, father—you, brothers, sisters, friends,)
For all my days—not those of peace alone—the days of war the 
same,
For gentle words, caresses, gifts from foreign lands,
For shelter, wine and meat—for sweet appreciation,
(You distant, dim unknown—or young or old—countless, un
specified, readers belov'd,
We never met, and ne'er shall meet—and yet our souls embrace, 
long, close and long;)
For beings, groups, love, deeds, words, books—for colors, forms,
For all the brave strong men—devoted, hardy men—who've for
ward sprung in freedom's help, all years, all lands,
For braver, stronger, more devoted men—(a special laurel ere I 
go, to life's war's chosen ones,
The cannoneers of song and thought—the great artillerists—the 
foremost leaders, captains of the soul:)
As soldier from an ended war return'd—As traveler out of 
myriads, to the long procession retrospective,
Thanks—joyful thanks!—a soldier's, traveler's thanks.


LIFE AND DEATH.

The two old, simple problems ever intertwined,
Close home, elusive, present, baffled, grappled.
By each successive age insoluble, pass'd on,
To ours today—and we pass on the same.



                                      




THE VOICE OF THE RAIN.

And who art thou? said I to the softfalling shower,
Which, strange to tell, gave me an answer, as here translated:
I am the Poem of Earth, said the voice of the rain,
Eternal I rise impalpable out of the land and the bottomless sea,
Upward to heaven, whence, vaguely form'd, altogether changed, 
and yet the same,
I descend to lave the drouths, atomies, dustlayers of the globe,
And all that in them without me were seeds only, latent, unborn;
And forever, by day and night, I give back life to my own 
origin, and make pure and beautify it;
(For song, issuing from its birthplace, after fulfilment, wander 
ing,
Reck'd or unreck'd. duly with love returns.)


SOON SHALL THE WINTER'S FOIL BE HERE.

Soon shall the winter's foil be here;
Soon shall these icy ligatures unbind and melt—A little while,
And air, soil, wave, suffused shall be in softness, bloom and 
growth—a thousand forms shall rise
From these dead clods and chills as from low burial graves.
Thine eyes, ears—all thy best attributes—all that takes cognizance 
of natural beauty,
Shall wake and fill. Thou shalt perceive the simple shows, the 
delicate miracles of earth,
Dandelions, clover, the emerald grass, the early scents and flow
ers,
The arbutus under foot, the willow's yellowgreen, the blossom
ing plum and cherry;
With these the robin, lark and thrush, singing their songs—the 
flitting bluebird;
For such the scenes the annual play brings on.


WHILE NOT THE PAST FORGETTING.

While not the past forgetting,
Today, at least, contention sunk entire—peace, brotherhood up
risen;
For sign reciprocal our Northern, Southern hands,
Lay on the graves of all dead soldiers, North or South,
(Nor for the past alone—for meanings to the future,)
Wreaths of roses and branches of palm.

THE DYING VETERAN.

A Long Island incident—early part of the present century.

Amid these days of order, ease, prosperity,
Amid the current songs of beauty, peace, decorum,
I cast a reminiscence—(likely 'twill offend you,
I heard it in my boyhood;)—More than a generation since,
A queer old savage man, a fighter under Washington himself,
(Large, brave, cleanly, hotblooded, no talker, rather spiritual
istic,
Had fought in the ranks—fought well—had been all through the 
Revolutionary war,)
Lay dying—sons, daughters, churchdeacons, lovingly tending 
him,
Sharping their sense, their ears, towards his murmuring, half
caught words:
"Let me return again to my wardays,
To the sights and scenes—to forming the line of battle,
To the scouts ahead reconnoitering,
To the cannons, the grim artillery,
To the galloping aids, carrying orders,
To the wounded, the fallen, the heat, the suspense,
The perfume strong, the smoke, the deafening noise;
Away with your life of peace!—your joys of peace!
Give me my old wild battlelife again!"


STRONGER LESSONS.

Have you learn'd lessons only of those who admired you, and 
were tender with you, and stood aside for you?
Have you not learn'd great lessons from those who reject you, 
and brace themselves against you? or who treat you with 
contempt, or dispute the passage with you?


A PRAIRIE SUNSET.

Shot gold, maroon and violet, dazzling silver, emerald, fawn,
The earth's whole amplitude and Nature's multiform power con
sign'd for once to colors;
The light, the general air possess'd by them—colors till now un
known,
No limit, confine—not the Western sky alone—the high meri
dian—North, South, all,
Pure luminous color fighting the silent shadows to the last.



                                      




TWENTY YEARS.

Down on the ancient wharf, the sand, I sit, with a newcomer 
chatting:
He shipp'd as greenhand boy, and sail'd away, (took some sud
den, vehement notion;)
Since, twenty years and more have circled round and round,
While he the globe was circling round and round,—and now 
returns:
How changed the place—all the old landmarks gone—the 
parents dead;
(Yes, he comes back to lay in port for good—to settle— has a well
fill'd purse—no spot will do but this;)
The little boat that scull'd him from the sloop, now held in 
leash I see,
I hear the slapping waves, the restless keel, the rocking in the 
sand,
I see the sailor kit, the canvas bag, the great box bound with 
brass,
I scan the face all berrybrown and bearded—the stoutstrong 
frame,
Dress'd in its russet suit of good Scotch cloth:
(Then what the toldout story of those twenty years? What of 
the future?)


ORANGE BUDS BY MAIL FROM FLORIDA.

Voltaire closed a famous argument by claiming that a ship of war and the grand opera were proofs enough of civilization's and France's progress, in his day.

A lesser proof than old Voltaire's, yet greater,
Proof of this present time, and thee, thy broad expanse, 
America,
To my plain Northern hut, in outside clouds and snow,
Brought safely for a thousand miles o'er land and tide,
Some three days since on their own soil livesprouting,
Now here their sweetness through my room unfolding,
A bunch of orange buds by mail from Florida.


TWILIGHT.

The soft voluptuous opiate shades,
The sun just gone, the eager light dispell'd—(I too will soon be 
gone, dispell'd,)
A haze—nirwana—rest and night—oblivion.



                                      




YOU LINGERING SPARSE LEAVES OF ME.

You lingering sparse leaves of me on winternearing boughs,
And I some wellshorn tree of field or orchardrow;
You tokens diminute and lorn—(not now the flush of May, or 
July cloverbloom—no grain of August now;)
You pallid bannerstaves—you pennants valueless—you over
stay'd of time,
Yet my souldearest leaves confirming all the rest,
The faithfulest—hardiest—last.


NOT MEAGRE, LATENT BOUGHS ALONE.

Not meagre, latent boughs alone, O songs! (scaly and bare, 
like eagles' talons,)
But haply for some sunny day (who knows?) some future spring, 
some summer—bursting forth,
To verdant leaves, or sheltering shade—to nourishing fruit,
Apples and grapes—the stalwart limbs of trees emerging—the 
fresh, free, open air,
And love and faith, like scented roses blooming.


THE DEAD EMPEROR.

Today, with bending head and eyes, thou, too, Columbia,
Less for the mighty crown laid low in sorrow—less for the 
Emperor,
Thy true condolence breathest, sendest out o'er many a salt sea 
mile,
Mourning a good old man—a faithful shepherd, patriot.

AS THE GREEK'S SIGNAL FLAME.

For Whittier's eightieth birthday, December , .

As the Greek's signal flame, by antique records told,
Rose from the hilltop, like applause and glory,
Welcoming in fame some special veteran, hero,
With rosy tinge reddening the land he'd served,
So I aloft from Mannahatta's shipfringed shore,
Lift high a kindled brand for thee, Old Poet.



                                      




THE DISMANTLED SHIP.

In some unused lagoon, some nameless bay,
On sluggish, lonesome waters, anchor'd near the shore,
An old, dismasted, gray and batter'd ship, disabled, done,
After free voyages to all the seas of earth, haul'd up at last and 
hawser'd tight,
Lies rusting, mouldering.


NOW PRECEDENT SONGS, FAREWELL.

Now precedent songs, farewell—by every name farewell,
(Trains of a staggering line in many a strange procession, 
waggons,
From ups and downs—with intervals—from elder years, midage, 
or youth,)
"In Cabin'd Ships," or "Thee Old Cause" or "Poets to Come"
Or "Paumanok," "Song of Myself," "Calamus," or "Adam,"
Or "Beat! Beat! Drums!" or "To the Leaven'd Soil they 
Trod,"
Or "Captain! My Captain!" "Kosmos," "Quicksand Years," 
or "Thoughts,"
"Thou Mother with thy Equal Brood," and many, many more 
unspecified,
From fibre heart of mine—from throat and tongue—(My life's 
hot pulsing blood,
The personal urge and form for me—not merely paper, automatic 
type and ink,)
Each song of mine—each utterance in the past—having its long, 
long history,
Of life or death, or soldier's wound, of country's loss or safety,
(O heaven! what flash and started endless train of all! com
pared indeed to that!
What wretched shred e'en at the best of all!)


AN EVENING LULL.

After a week of physical anguish,
Unrest and pain, and feverish heat,
Toward the ending day a calm and lull comes on,
Three hours of peace and soothing rest of brain.*



* *The two songs on this page are eked out during an afternoon, June, , in my seventieth year, at a critical spell of illness. Of course no reader and probably no human being at any time will ever have such phases of emotional and solemn action as these involve to me. I feel them an end and close of all.



                                      




OLD AGE'S LAMBENT PEAKS.

The touch of flame—the illuminating fire—the loftiest look at 
last,
O'er city, passion, sea—o'er prairie, mountain, wood—the earth 
itself;
The airy, different, changing hues of all, in falling twilight,
Objects and groups, bearings, faces, reminiscences;
The calmer sight—the golden setting, clear and broad:
So much i' the atmosphere, the points of view, the situations 
whence we scan,
Bro't out by them alone—so much (perhaps the best) unreck'd 
before;
The lights indeed from them—old age's lambent peaks.


AFTER THE SUPPER AND TALK.

After the supper and talk—after the day is done,
As a friend from friends his final withdrawal prolonging,
Goodbye and Goodbye with emotional lips repeating,
(So hard for his hand to release those hands—no more will they 
meet,
No more for communion of sorrow and joy, of old and young,
A farstretching journey awaits him, to return no more,)
Shunning, postponing severance—seeking to ward off the last 
word ever so little,
E'en at the exitdoor turning—charges superfluous calling back— 
e'en as he descends the steps,
Something to eke out a minute additional—shadows of nightfall 
deepening,
Farewells, messages lessening—dimmer the forthgoer's visage 
and form,
Soon to be lost for aye in the darkness—loth, O so loth to de
part!
Garrulous to the very last.


        

GOODBYE MY FANCY.

SAIL OUT FOR GOOD, EIDÓLON YACHT!

HEAVE the anchor short!
Raise mainsail and jib—steer forth,
O little whitehull'd sloop, now speed on really deep waters,
(I will not call it our concluding voyage,
But outset and sure entrance to the truest, best, maturest;)
Depart, depart from solid earth—no more returning to these 
shores,
Now on for aye our infinite free venture wending,
Spurning all yet tried ports, seas, hawsers, densities, gravitation,
Sail out for good, eidólon yacht of me!


LINGERING LAST DROPS.

AND whence and why come you?

We know not whence, (was the answer,)
We only know that we drift here with the rest,
That we linger'd and lagg'd—but were wafted at last, and are 
now here,
To make the passing shower's concluding drops.


GOODBYE MY FANCY.

GOODBYE * my fancy—(I had a word to say,
But 'tis not quite the time—The best of any man's word or say,
Is when its proper place arrives—and for its meaning,
I keep mine till the last.)


**Behind a Goodbye there lurks much of the salutation of another beginning—to me, Development, Continuity, Immortality, Transformation, are the chiefest lifemeanings of Nature and Humanity, and are the sine qua non of all facts, and each fact. 

Why do folks dwell so fondly on the last words, advice, appearance, of the departing? Those last words are not samples of the best, which involve vitality at its full, and balance, and perfect control and scope. But they are valuable beyond measure to confirm and endorse the varied train, facts, theories and faith of the whole preceding life.




                                      




ON, ON THE SAME, YE JOCUND TWAIN!

ON, on the same, ye jocund twain!
My life and recitative, containing birth, youth, midage years,
Fitful as motleytongues of flame, inseparably twined and merged 
in one—combining all,
My single soul—aims, confirmations, failures, joys—Nor single 
soul alone,
I chant my nation's crucial stage, (America's, haply humanity's) 
—the trial great, the victory great,
A strange eclaircissement of all the masses past, the eastern 
world, the ancient, medieval,
Here, here from wanderings, strayings, lessons, wars, defeats— 
here at the west a voice triumphant—justifying all,
A gladsome pealing cry—a song for once of utmost pride and 
satisfaction;
I chant from it the common bulk, the general average horde, 
(the best no sooner than the worst)—And now I chant old 
age,
(My verses, written first for forenoon life, and for the summer's, 
autumn's spread,
I pass to snowwhite hairs the same, and give to pulses winter 
cool'd the same;)
As here in careless trill, I and my recitatives, with faith and 
love,
Wafting to other work, to unknown songs, conditions,
On, on, ye jocund twain! continue on the same!


MY ST YEAR.

AFTER surmounting threescore and ten,
With all their chances, changes, losses, sorrows,
My parents' deaths, the vagaries of my life, the many tearing 
passions of me, the war of ' and ',
As some old broken soldier, after a long, hot, wearying march, 
or haply after battle,
Today at twilight, hobbling, answering company rollcall, Here, 
with vital voice,
Reporting yet, saluting yet the Officer over all.


APPARITIONS.

A VAGUE mist hanging 'round half the pages:
(Sometimes how strange and clear to the soul,
That all these solid things are indeed but apparitions, concepts, 
nonrealities.)



                                      




THE PALLID WREATH.

SOMEHOW I cannot let it go yet, funeral though it is,
Let it remain back there on its nail suspended,
With pink, blue, yellow, all blanch'd, and the white now gray 
and ashy,
One wither'd rose put years ago for thee, dear friend;
But I do not forget thee. Hast thou then faded?
Is the odor exhaled? Are the colors, vitalities, dead?
No, while memories subtly play—the past vivid as ever;
For but last night I woke, and in that spectral ring saw thee,
Thy smile, eyes, face, calm, silent, loving as ever:
So let the wreath hang still awhile within my eyereach,
It is not yet dead to me, nor even pallid.


AN ENDED DAY.

The soothing sanity and blitheness of completion,
The pomp and hurried contestglare and rush are done;
Now triumph! transformation! jubilate!*


**NOTE.—Summer country life.—Several years.—In my rambles and explorations I found a woody place near the creek, where for some reason the birds in happy mood seem'd to resort in unusual numbers. Especially at the beginning of the day, and again at the ending, I was sure to get there the most copious birdconcerts. I repair'd there frequently at sunrise—and also at sunset, or just before . . . Once the question arose in me: Which is the best singing, the first or the lattermost? The first always exhilerated, and perhaps seem'd more joyous and stronger; but I always felt the sunset or late afternoon sounds more penetrating and sweeter—seem'd to touch the soul—often the evening thrushes, two or three of them, responding and perhaps blending. Though I miss'd some of the mornings, I found myself getting to be quite strictly punctual at the evening utterances.

ANOTHER NOTE.—"He went out with the tide and the sunset," was a phrase I heard from a surgeon describing an old sailor's death under peculiarly gentle conditions. 

During the Secession War,  and ', visiting the Army Hospitals around Washington, I form'd the habit, and continued it to the end, whenever the ebb or flood tide began the latter part of day, of punctually visiting those at that time populous wards of suffering men. Somehow (or I thought it so) the effect of the hour was palpable. The badly wounded would get some ease, and would like to talk a little, or be talk'd to. Intellectual and emotional natures would be at their best: Deaths were always easier; medicines seem'd to have better effect when given then, and a lulling atmosphere would pervade the wards. 

Similar influences, similar circumstances and hours, dayclose, after great battles, even with all their horrors. I had more than once the same experience on the fields cover'd with fallen or dead.




                                      




OLD AGE'S SHIP & CRAFTY DEATH'S.

FROM east and west across the horizon's edge,
Two mighty masterful vessels sailers steal upon us:
But we'll make race atime upon the seas—a battlecontest yet! 
bear lively there!
(Our joys of strife and derringdo to the last!)
Put on the old ship all her power today!
Crowd topsail, topgallant and royal studdingsails,
Out challenge and defiance—flags and flaunting pennants added,
As we take to the open—take to the deepest, freest waters.


TO THE PENDING YEAR.

HAVE I no weaponword for thee—some message brief and 
fierce?
(Have I fought out and done indeed the battle?) Is there no shot 
left,
For all thy affectations, lisps, scorns, manifold silliness?
Nor for myself—my own rebellious self in thee?

Down, down, proud gorge!—though choking thee;
Thy bearded throat and highborne forehead to the gutter;
Crouch low thy neck to eleemosynary gifts.


SHAKSPEREBACON'S CIPHER.

I DOUBT it not—then more, far more;
In each old song bequeath'd—in every noble page or text,
(Different—something unreck'd before—some unsuspected 
author,)
In every object, mountain, tree, and star—in every birth and 
life,
As part of each—evolv'd from each—meaning, behind the os
tent,
A mystic cipher waits infolded.


LONG, LONG HENCE.

AFTER a long, long course, hundreds of years, denials,
Accumulations, rous'd love and joy and thought,
Hopes, wishes, aspirations, ponderings, victories, myriads of 
readers,
Coating, compassing, covering—after ages' and ages' encrus
tations,
Then only may these songs reach fruition.



                                      




BRAVO, PARIS EXPOSITION!

ADD to your show, before you close it, France,
With all the rest, visible, concrete, temples, towers, goods, ma
chines and ores,
Our sentiment wafted from many million heartthrobs, ethereal 
but solid,
(We grandsons and greatgrandsons do not forget your grand
sires,)
From fifty Nations and nebulous Nations, compacted, sent over
sea today,
America's applause, love, memories and goodwill.


INTERPOLATION SOUNDS.


OVER and through the burial chant,
Organ and solemn service, sermon, bending priests,
To me come interpolation sounds not in the show—plainly to 
me, crowding up the aisle and from the window,
Of sudden battle's hurry and harsh noises—war's grim game to 
sight and ear in earnest;
The scout call'd up and forward—the general mounted and his 
aids around him—the newbrought word—the instantaneous 
order issued;
The rifle crack—the cannon thud—the rushing forth of men 
from their tents;
The clank of cavalry—the strange celerity of forming ranks— 
the slender bugle note;
The sound of horses' hoofs departing—saddles, arms, accoutre
ments.


                                




TO THE SUNSET BREEZE.

AH, whispering, something again, unseen,
Where late this heated day thou enterest at my window, door,
Thou, laving, tempering all, coolfreshing, gently vitalizing
Me, old, alone, sick, weakdown, meltedworn with sweat;
Thou, nestling, folding close and firm yet soft, companion bet
ter than talk, book, art,
(Thou hast, O Nature! elements! utterance to my heart beyond 
the rest—and this is of them,)
So sweet thy primitive taste to breathe within—thy soothing 
fingers on my face and hands,
Thou, messengermagical strange bringer to body and spirit of 
me,
(Distances balk'd—occult medicines penetrating me from head 
to foot,)
I feel the sky, the prairies vast—I feel the mighty northern 
lakes,
I feel the ocean and the forest—somehow I feel the globe itself 
swiftswimming in space;
Thou blown from lips so loved, now gone—haply from endless 
store, Godsent,
(For thou art spiritual, Godly, most of all known to my 
sense,)
Minister to speak to me, here and now, what word has never 
told, and cannot tell,
Art thou not universal concrete's distillation? Law's, all As
tronomy's last refinement?
Hast thou no soul? Can I not know, identify thee?


OLD CHANTS.

AN ancient song, reciting, ending,
Once gazing toward thee, Mother of All,
Musing, seeking themes fitted for thee,
Accept for me, thou saidst, the elder ballads,
And name for me before thou goest each ancient poet.

(Of many debts incalculable,
Haply our New World's chieftest debt is to old poems.)

Ever so far back, preluding thee, America,
Old chants, Egyptian priests, and those of Ethiopia,
The Hindu epics, the Grecian, Chinese, Persian,
The Biblic books and prophets, and deep idyls of the Naza
rene,


                                      



The Iliad, Odyssey, plots, doings, wanderings of Eneas,
Hesiod, Eschylus, Sophocles, Merlin, Arthur,
The Cid, Roland at Roncesvalles, the Nibelungen,
The troubadours, minstrels, minnesingers, skalds,
Chaucer, Dante, flocks of singing birds,
The Border Minstrelsy, the byegone ballads, feudal tales, essays, 
plays,
Shakspere, Schiller, Walter Scott, Tennyson,
As some vast wondrous weird dreampresences,
The great shadowy groups gathering around,
Darting their mighty masterful eyes forward at thee,
Thou! with as now thy bending neck and head, with courteous 
hand and word, ascending,
Thou! pausing a moment, drooping thine eyes upon them, blent 
with their music,
Well pleased, accepting all, curiously prepared for by them,
Thou enterest at thy entrance porch.


A CHRISTMAS GREETING.
From a Northern StarGroup to a Southern. '.

WELCOME, Brazilian brother—thy ample place is ready;
A loving hand—a smile from the north—a sunny instant hail!
(Let the future care for itself, where it reveals its troubles, im
pedimentas,
Ours, ours the present throe, the democratic aim, the acceptance 
and the faith;)
To thee today our reaching arm, our turning neck—to thee 
from us the expectant eye,
Thou cluster free! thou brilliant lustrous one! thou, learning well,
The true lesson of a nation's light in the sky,
(More shining than the Cross, more than the Crown,)
The height to be superb humanity.


SOUNDS OF THE WINTER.

SOUNDS of the winter too,
Sunshine upon the mountains—many a distant strain
From cheery railroad train—from nearer field, barn, house,
The whispering air—even the mute crops, garner'd apples, corn,
Children's and women's tones—rhythm of many a farmer and 
of flail,
An old man's garrulous lips among the rest, Think not we give 
out yet,
Forth from these snowy hairs we keep up yet the lilt.



                                      




A TWILIGHT SONG.

AS I sit in twilight late alone by the flickering oakflame,
Musing on longpass'd warscenes—of the countless buried un
known soldiers,
Of the vacant names, as unindented air's and sea's—the un
return'd,
The brief truce after battle, with grim burialsquads, and the 
deepfill'd trenches
Of gather'd dead from all America, North, South, East, West, 
whence they came up,
From wooded Maine, NewEngland's farms, from fertile Penn
sylvania, Illinois, Ohio,
From the measureless West, Virginia, the South, the Carolinas, 
Texas,
(Even here in my roomshadows and halflights in the noiseless 
flickering flames,
Again I see the stalwart ranks onfiling, rising—I hear the 
rhythmic tramp of the armies;)
You million unwrit names all, all—you dark bequest from all the 
war,
A special verse for you—a flash of duty long neglected—your 
mystic roll strangely gather'd here,
Each name recall'd by me from out the darkness and death's 
ashes,
Henceforth to be, deep, deep within my heart recording, for 
many a future year,
Your mystic roll entire of unknown names, or North or 
South,
Embalm'd with love in this twilight song.


WHEN THE FULLGROWN POET CAME.

WHEN the fullgrown poet came,
Out spake pleased Nature (the round impassive globe, with all 
its shows of day and night,) saying, He is mine;
But out spake too the Soul of man, proud, jealous and unrec
onciled, Nay, he is mine alone;
—Then the fullgrown poet stood between the two, and took 
each by the hand;
And today and ever so stands, as blender, uniter, tightly hold
ing hands,
Which he will never release until he reconciles the two,
And wholly and joyously blends them.



                                      




OSCEOLA.

When I was nearly grown to manhood in Brooklyn, New York, (middle of ,) I met one of the return'd U. S. Marines from Fort Moultrie, S. C., and had long talks with him—learn'd the occurrence below described—death of Osceola. The latter was a young, brave, leading Seminole in the Florida war of that time—was surrender'd to our troops, imprison'd and literally died of "a broken heart," at Fort Moultrie. He sicken'd of his confinement—the doctor and officers made every allowance and kindness possible for him; then the close:

WHEN his hour for death had come,
He slowly rais'd himself from the bed on the floor,
Drew on his wardress, shirt, leggings, and girdled the belt 
around his waist,
Call'd for vermilion paint (his lookingglass was held before 
him,)
Painted half his face and neck, his wrists, and backhands.
Put the scalpknife carefully in his belt—then lying down, resting 
a moment,
Rose again, half sitting, smiled, gave in silence his extended 
hand to each and all,
Sank faintly low to the floor (tightly grasping the tomahawk 
handle,)
Fix'd his look on wife and little children—the last:
(And here a line in memory of his name and death.)


A VOICE FROM DEATH.
(The Johnstown, Penn., cataclysm, May , .)

A VOICE from Death, solemn and strange, in all his sweep and 
power,
With sudden, indescribable blow—towns drown'd—humanity by 
thousands slain,
The vaunted work of thrift, goods, dwellings, forge, street, iron 
bridge,
Dash'd pellmell by the blow—yet usher'd life continuing on,
(Amid the rest, amid the rushing, whirling, wild debris,
A suffering woman saved—a baby safely born!)

Although I come and unannounc'd, in horror and in pang,
In pouring flood and fire, and wholesale elemental crash, (this 
voice so solemn, strange,)
I too a minister of Deity.

Yea, Death, we bow our faces, veil our eyes to thee,
We mourn the old, the young untimely drawn to thee,
The fair, the strong, the good, the capable,


                                      



The household wreck'd, the husband and the wife, the engulf'd 
forger in his forge,
The corpses in the whelming waters and the mud,
The gather'd thousands to their funeral mounds, and thousands 
never found or gather'd.

Then after burying, mourning the dead,
(Faithful to them found or unfound, forgetting not, bearing the 
past, here new musing,)
A day—a passing moment or an hour—America itself bends low,
Silent, resign'd, submissive.

War, death, cataclysm like this, America,
Take deep to thy proud prosperous heart.

E'en as I chant, lo! out of death, and out of ooze and slime,
The blossoms rapidly blooming, sympathy, help, love,
From West and East, from South and North and over sea,
Its hotspurr'd hearts and hands humanity to human aid moves on;
And from within a thought and lesson yet.

Thou everdarting Globe! through Space and Air!
Thou waters that encompass us!
Thou that in all the life and death of us, in action or in sleep!
Thou laws invisible that permeate them and all,
Thou that in all, and over all, and through and under all, 
incessant!
Thou! thou! the vital, universal, giant force resistless, sleepless, 
calm,
Holding Humanity as in thy open hand, as some ephemeral toy,
How ill to e'er forget thee!

For I too have forgotten,
(Wrapt in these little potencies of progress, politics, culture, 
wealth, inventions, civilization,)
Have lost my recognition of your silent everswaying power, 
ye mighty, elemental throes,
In which and upon which we float, and every one of us is 
buoy'd.


A PERSIAN LESSON.

FOR his o'erarching and last lesson the greybeard sufi,
In the fresh scent of the morning in the open air,
On the slope of a teeming Persian rosegarden,
Under an ancient chestnuttree wide spreading its branches,
Spoke to the young priests and students.



                                      



"Finally my children, to envelop each word, each part of the 
rest,
Allah is all, all, all—is immanent in every life and object,
Maybe at many and manyamore removes—yet Allah, Allah, 
Allah is there.

"Has the estray wander'd far? Is the reasonwhy strangely 
hidden?
Would you sound below the restless ocean of the entire world?
Would you know the dissatisfaction? the urge and spur of every 
life;
The something never still'd—never entirely gone? the invisible 
need of every seed?

"It is the central urge in every atom,
(Often unconscious, often evil, downfallen,)
To return to its divine source and origin, however distant,
Latent the same in subject and in object, without one exception."


THE COMMONPLACE.

THE commonplace I sing;
How cheap is health! how cheap nobility!
Abstinence, no falsehood, no gluttony, lust;
The open air I sing, freedom, toleration,
(Take here the mainest lesson—less from books—less from the 
schools,)
The common day and night—the common earth and waters,
Your farm—your work, trade, occupation,
The democratic wisdom underneath, like solid ground for all.


"THE ROUNDED CATALOGUE DIVINE COMPLETE."

Sunday,–– – ––.–Went this forenoon to church. A college professor, Rev. Dr.——, gave us a fine sermon, during which I caught the above words; but the minister included in his "rounded catalogue" letter and spirit, only the esthetic things, and entirely ignored what I name in the following:

The devilish and the dark, the dying and diseas'd,
The countless (nineteentwentieths) low and evil, crude and 
savage,
The crazed, prisoners in jail, the horrible, rank, malignant,
Venom and filth, serpents, the ravenous sharks, liars, the disso
lute;
(What is the part the wicked and the loathesome bear within 
earth's orbic scheme?)
Newts, crawling things in slime and mud, poisons,
The barren soil, the evil men, the slag and hideous rot.



                                      




MIRAGES. 

(Noted verbatim after a suppertalk out doors in Nevada with two old miners.)

MORE experiences and sights, stranger, than you'd think for;
Times again, now mostly just after sunrise or before sunset,
Sometimes in spring, oftener in autumn, perfectly clear weather, 
in plain sight,
Camps far or near, the crowded streets of cities and the shop
fronts,
(Account for it or not—credit or not—it is all true,
And my mate there could tell you the like—we have often con
fab'd about it,)
People and scenes, animals, trees, colors and lines, plain as could 
be,
Farms and dooryards of home, paths border'd with box, lilacs 
in corners,
Weddings in churches, thanksgiving dinners, returns of long
absent sons,
Glum funerals, the crapeveil'd mother and the daughters,
Trials in courts, jury and judge, the accused in the box,
Contestants, battles, crowds, bridges, wharves,
Now and then mark'd faces of sorrow or joy,
(I could pick them out this moment if I saw them again,)
Show'd to me just aloft to the right in the skyedge,
Or plainly there to the left on the hilltops.


L. OF G.'S PURPORT.

NOT to exclude or demarcate, or pick out evils from their formid
able masses (even to expose them,)
But add, fuse, complete, extend—and celebrate the immortal and 
the good.

Haughty this song, its words and scope,
To span vast realms of space and time,
Evolution—the cumulative—growths and generations.

Begun in ripen'd youth and steadily pursued,
Wandering, peering, dallying with all—war, peace, day and 
night absorbing,
Never even for one brief hour abandoning my task,
I end it here in sickness, poverty, and old age.

I sing of life, yet mind me well of death:
Today shadowy Death dogs my steps, my seated shape, and 
has for years—
Draws sometimes close to me, as face to face.



                                      




THE UNEXPRESS'D.

HOW dare one say it?
After the cycles, poems, singers, plays,
Vaunted Ionia's, India's—Homer, Shakspere—the long, long 
times' thick dotted roads, areas,
The shining clusters and the Milky Ways of stars—Nature's 
pulses reap'd,
All retrospective passions, heroes, war, love, adoration,
All ages' plummets dropt to their utmost depths,
All human lives, throats, wishes, brains—all experiences' utter
ance;
After the countless songs, or long or short, all tongues, all lands,
Still something not yet told in poesy's voice or print—something 
lacking,
(Who knows? the best yet unexpress'd and lacking.)


GRAND IS THE SEEN.

GRAND is the seen, the light, to me—grand are the sky and 
stars,
Grand is the earth, and grand are lasting time and space,
And grand their laws, so multiform, puzzling, evolutionary;
But grander far the unseen soul of me, comprehending, endow
ing all those,
Lighting the light, the sky and stars, delving the earth, sailing 
the sea,
(What were all those, indeed, without thee, unseen soul? of 
what amount without thee?)
More evolutionary, vast, puzzling, O my soul!
More multiform far—more lasting thou than they.


UNSEEN BUDS.

UNSEEN buds, infinite, hidden well,
Under the snow and ice, under the darkness, in every square or 
cubic inch,
Germinal, exquisite, in delicate lace, microscopic, unborn,
Like babes in wombs, latent, folded, compact, sleeping;
Billions of billions, and trillions of trillions of them waiting,
(On earth and in the sea—the universe—the stars there in the 
heavens,)
Urging slowly, surely forward, forming endless,
And waiting ever more, forever more behind.



                                      




GOODBYE MY FANCY!

GOODBYE my Fancy!
Farewell dear mate, dear love!
I'm going away, I know not where,
Or to what fortune, or whether I may ever see you again,
So Goodbye my Fancy.

Now for my last—let me look back a moment;
The slower fainter ticking of the clock is in me,
Exit, nightfall, and soon the heartthud stopping.

Long have we lived, joy'd, caress'd together;
Delightful!—now separation—Goodbye my Fancy.

Yet let me not be too hasty,
Long indeed have we lived, slept, filter'd, become really blended 
into one;
Then if we die we die together, (yes, we'll remain one,)
If we go anywhere we'll go together to meet what happens,
Maybe we'll be better off and blither, and learn something,
Maybe it is yourself now really ushering me to the true songs, 
(who knows?)
Maybe it is you the mortal knob really undoing, turning—so 
now finally,
Goodbye—and hail! my Fancy.



INTO MY OWN 

One of my wishes is that those dark trees, 
So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze, 
Were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom, 
But stretched away unto the edge of doom. 

I should not be withheld but that some day 
Into their vastness I should steal away, 
Fearless of ever finding open land, 
Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand. 

I do not see why I should e'er turn back, 
Or those should not set forth upon my track 
To overtake me, who should miss me hdre 
And long to know if still I held them dg&r. 

They would not find me changed from him they 

knew 
Only more sure of all I thought was true. 



GHOST HOUSE 

I dwell in a lonely house I know 

That vanished many a summer ago, 
And left no trace but the cellar walls, 
And a cellar in which the daylight falls, 

And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow. 

O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield 
The woods come back to the mowing field; 
The orchard tree has grown one copse 
Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops; 
The footpath down to the well is healed. 

I dwell with a strangely aching heart 

In that vanished abode there far apart 
On that disused and forgotten road 
That has no dust-bath now for the toad. 

Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart; 

The whippoorwill is coming to shout 
And hush and cluck and flutter about: 

I hear him begin far enough away 

Full many a time to say his say 
Before he arrives to say it out. 



THE PASTURE 

I'm going out to clean the pasture spring; 
I'll only stop to rake the leaves away 
(And wait to watch the water clear, I may): 
I sha'n't be gone long. You come too. 

I'm going out to fetch the little calf 
That's standing by the mother. It's so young. 
It totters when she licks it with her tongue. 
I sha'n't be gone long. You come too. 



INTO MY OWN 

One of my wishes is that those dark trees, 
So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze, 
Were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom, 
But stretched away unto the edge of doom. 

I should not be withheld but that some day 
Into their vastness I should steal away, 
Fearless of ever finding open land, 
Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand. 

I do not see why I should e'er turn back, 
Or those should not set forth upon my track 
To overtake me, who should miss me hdre 
And long to know if still I held them dg&r. 

They would not find me changed from him they 

knew 
Only more sure of all I thought was true. 



GHOST HOUSE 

I dwell in a lonely house I know 

That vanished many a summer ago, 
And left no trace but the cellar walls, 
And a cellar in which the daylight falls, 

And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow. 

O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield 
The woods come back to the mowing field; 
The orchard tree has grown one copse 
Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops; 
The footpath down to the well is healed. 

I dwell with a strangely aching heart 

In that vanished abode there far apart 
On that disused and forgotten road 
That has no dust-bath now for the toad. 

Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart; 

The whippoorwill is coming to shout 
And hush and cluck and flutter about: 

I hear him begin far enough away 

Full many a time to say his say 
Before he arrives to say it out. 



It is under the small, dim, summer star. 

\ know not who these mute folk are 
Who share the unlit place with me 
Those stones out under the low-limbed tree 

Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar. 

They are tireless folk, but slow and sad, 
Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad, 
With none among them that ever sings, 
And yet, in view of how many things, 
rVs sweet companions as might be had. 



MY NOVEMBER GUEST 

JVly Sorrow, when she's here with me, 
Thinks these dark days of autumn rain 

Are beautiful as days can be; 

She loves the bare, the withered tree; 
She walks the sodden pasture lane. 

Her pleasure will not let me stay. 

She talks and I am fain to list: 
She's glad the birds are gone away, 
She's glad her simple worsted grey 

Is silver now with clinging mist. 

The desolate, deserted trees, 

The faded earth, the heavy sky, 
The beauties she so truly sees, 
She thinks I have no eye for these, 
And vexes me for reason why. 

Not yesterday I learned to know 
The love of bare November days 

Before the coming of the snow, 

But it were vain to tell her so, 

And they are better for her praise. 



TO THE THAWING WIND 

C^ome with rain, O loud Southwester! 

Bring the singer, bring the nester; 

Give the buried flower a dream; 

Make the settled snow-bank stream; 

Find the brown beneath the white; 

But whate'er you do to-night, 

Bathe my window, make it flow > 

Melt it as the ice will go; 

Melt the glass and leave the sticks 

Like a hermit's crucifix; 

Burst into my narrow stall; 

Swing the picture on the wall; 

Run the rattling pages o'er; 

Scatter poems on the floor; 

Turn the poet out of door.

A PRAYER IN SPRING 

Oh, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day; 
And give us not to think so far away 
As the uncertain harvest; keep us here 
All simply in the springing of the year. 

Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white, 
Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night; 
And make us happy in the happy bees, 
The swarm dilating round the perfect trees. 

And make us happy in the darting bird 
That suddenly above the bees is heard, 
The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill, 
And off a blossom in mid air stands still. 

For this is love and nothing else is love, 
The which it is reserved for God above 
To sanctify to what far ends He will, 
But which it only needs that we fulfil. 



13 



LOVE AND A QUESTION 

A Stranger came to the door at eve, 

And he spoke the bridegroom fair. 
He bore a green- white stick in his hand, 

And, for all burden, care. 
He asked with the eyes more than the lips 

For a shelter for the night, 
And he turned and looked at the road afar 

Without a window light. 

The bridegroom came forth into the porch 

With 'Let us look at the sky, 
And question what of the night to be, 

Stranger, you and I.' 
The woodbine leaves littered the yard, 

The woodbine berries were blue, 
Autumn, yes, winter 'was in the wind; 

* Stranger, I wish I knew.' 

Within, the bride in the dusk alone 

Bent over the open fire, 
Her face rose-red with the glowing coal 

And the thought of the heart's desire. 
The bridegroom, looked at the weary road, 

Yet saw but her within, 
And wished her heart in a case of gold 

And pinned with a silver pin. 



The bridegroom thought it little to give 

A dole of bread, a purse, 
A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God, 

Or for the rich a curse; 
But whether or not a man was asked 

To mar the love of two 
By harboring woe in the bridal house, 

The bridegroom wished he knew. 



STARS 

How countlessly they congregate 
O'er our tumultuous snow. 

Which flows in shapes as tall as trees 
"When wintry winds do blow! - 

As if with keenness for our fate, 
Our faltering few steps on 

To white rest, and a place of rest 
Invisible at dawn, 

And yet with neither love nor hate, 
Those stars like some snow-white 

Minerva's snow-white marble eyes 
Without the gift of sight. 



1C 



STORM FEAR 

\Vhen the wind works against us in the dark, 
And pelts with snow 
The lower chamber window on the east, 
And whispers with a sort of stifled bark, 
The beast, 

'Come out! Come outf- 
it costs no inward struggle not to go, 
Ah, no! 

I count our strength, 
Two and a child, 

Those of us not asleep subdued to mark 
How the cold creeps as the fire dies at length,- 
How drifts are piled, 
Dooryard and road ungraded, 
Till even the comforting barn grows far away, 
And my heart owns a doubt 
Whether 'tis in us to arise with day 
And save ourselves unaided. 



11 



TO THE THAWING WIND 



with rain, O loud South wester! 
Bring the singer, bring the nester; 
Give the buried flower a dream; 
Make the settled snow-bank stream; 
Find the brown beneath the white; 
But whatever you do to-night, 
Bathe my window, make it flow > 
Melt it as the ice will go; 
Melt the glass and leave the sticks 
Like a hermit's crucifix; 
Burst into my narrow stall; 
Swing the picture on the wall; 
Run the rattling pages o'er; 
Scatter poems on the floor; 
Turn the poet out of door. 



12 



A PRAYER IN SPRING 

Oh, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day; 
And give us not to think so far away 
As the uncertain harvest; keep us here 
All simply in the springing of the year. 

Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white, 
Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night; 
And make us happy in the happy bees, 
The swarm dilating round the perfect trees. 

And make us happy in the darting bird 
That suddenly above the bees is heard, 
The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill, 
And off a blossom in mid air stands still. 

For this is love and nothing else is love, 
The which it is reserved for God above 
To sanctify to what far ends He will, 
But which it only needs that we fulfil.

FLOWER-GATHERING 

1 left you in the morning, 

And in the morning glow, 

You walked a way beside me 

To make me sad to go. 

Do you know me in the gloaming, 

Gaunt and dusty grey with roaming? 

Are you dumb because you know me not, 

Or dumb because you know? 

All for me? And not a question 

For the faded flowers gay 

That could take me from beside you 

For the ages of a day? 

They are yours, and be the measure 

Of their worth for you to treasure, 

The measure of the little while 

That I've been long away. 



ROSE POGONIAS 

A saturated meadow, 

Sun-shaped and jewel-small, 
A circle scarcely wider 

Than the trees around were tall; 
Where winds were quite excluded, 

And the air was stifling sweet 
With the breath of many flowers, 

A temple of the heat. 

There we bowed us in the burning, 

As the sun's right worship is, 
To pick where none could miss them 

A thousand orchises; 
For though the grass was scattered, 

Yet every second spear 
Seemed tipped with wings of color, 

That tinged the atmosphere. 

We raised a simple prayer 

Before we left the spot, 
That in the general mowing 

That place might be forgot; 
Or if not all so favoured, 

Obtain such grace of hours, 
That none should mow the grass there 

While so confused with flowers. 



15 



WAITING 
AFIELD AT DUSK 

What things for dream there are when spectre-like, 

Moving among tall haycocks lightly piled, 

I enter alone upon the stubble field, 

From which the laborers' voices late have died, 

And in the antiphony of afterglow 

And rising full moon, sit me down 

Upon the full moon's side of the first haycock 

And lose myself amid so many alike. 

I dream upon the opposing lights of the hour, 
Preventing shadow until the moon prevail; 
I dream upon the night-hawks peopling heaven, 
Each circling each with vague unearthly cry, 
Or plunging headlong with fierce twang afar; 
And on the bat's mute antics, who would seem 
Dimly to have made out my secret place, 
Only to lose it when he pirouettes, 
And seek it endlessly with purblind haste; 
On the last swallow's sweep; and on the rasp 
In the abyss of odor and rustle at my back, 
That, silenced by my advent, finds once more, 
After an interval, his instrument, 
And tries once twice and thrice if I be there; 
And on the worn book of old-golden song 
I brought not here to read, it seems, but hold 

16 



And freshen in this air of withering sweetness; 

But on the memory of one absent most, 

For whom these lines when they shall greet her eye. 



17 



IN NEGLECT 



1 hey leave us so to the -way we took, 

As two in whom they were proved mistaken. 
That we sit sometimes in the wayside nook, 
With mischievous > vagrant, seraphic look, 
And try if we cannot feel forsaken. 



18 



THE VANTAGE POINT 

If tired of trees I seek again mankind, 

Well I know where to hie me in the dawn, 
To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn. 

There amid lolling juniper reclined, 

Myself unseen, I see in white defined fc 

Far off the homes of men, and farther still, 
The graves of men on an opposing hill, 

Living or dead, whichever are to mind. 

And if by noon I have too much of these, 
I have but to turn on my arm, and lo, 
The sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow, 

My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, 
I smell the earth, I smell the bruised plant, 
I look into the crater of the ant. 



19 



MOWING 

1 here was never a sound beside the wood but one, 
And that was my long scythe whispering to the 

ground. 

What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself; 
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun, 
Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound 
And that was why it whispered and did not speak. 
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours, 
Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf: 
Anything more than the truth would have seemed 

too weak 

To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows, 
Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers 
(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake. 
The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows. 
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make. 



20 



GOING FOR WATER 

1 he well was dry beside the door, 
And so we went with pail and can 

Across the fields behind the house 
To seek the brook if still it ran; 

Not loth to have excuse to go, 
Because the autumn eve was fair 

(Though chill), because the fields were ours, 
And by the brook our woods were there. 

We ran as if to meet the moon 

That slowly dawned behind the trees, 

The barren boughs without the leaves, 
Without the birds, without the breeze. 

But once within the wood, we paused 
Like gnomes that hid us from the moon, 

Ready to run to hiding new 

With laughter when she found us soon. 

Each laid on other a staying hand 

To listen ere we dared to look, 
And in the hush we joined to make 

We heard, we knew we heard the brook. 



21 



A note as from a single place, 
A slender tinkling fall that made 

Now drops that floated on the pool 
Like pearls, and now a silver blade. 



22 



REVELATION 

\Ve make ourselves a place apart 

Behind light words that tease and flout, 

But oh, the agitated heart 

Till someone find us really out. 

'Tis pity if the case require 
(Or so we say) that in the end 

We speak the literal to inspire 
The understanding of a friend. 

But so with all, from babes that play 
At hide-and-seek to God afar, 

So all who hide too well away 

Must speak and tell us where they are. 



THE TUFT OF FLOWERS 

1 went to turn the grass once after one 
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun. 

The dew was gone that made his blade so keen 
Before I came to view the levelled scene. 

f looked for him behind an isle of trees; 
I listened for his whetstone on the breeze. 

But he had gone his way, the grass all mown, 
And I must be, as he had been, alone, 

'As all must be/ I said within my heart, 
'Whether they work together or apart/ 

But as I said it, swift there passed me by 
On noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly, 

Seeking with memories grown dim o'er night 
Some resting flower of yesterday's deKght. 

And once I marked his flight go round and round, 
As where some flower lay withering on the ground, 
i 

And then he flew as far as eye could see, 

And then on tremulous wing came back to me. 



I thought of questions that have no reply, 
And would have turned to toss the grass to dry; 

But he turned first, and led my eye to look 
At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook, 

A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared 
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared. 

I left my place to know them by their name, 
Finding them butterfly weed when I came. 

The mower in the dew had loved them thus, 
By leaving them to flourish, not for us, 

Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him, 
But from sheer morning gladness at the brim. 

The butterfly and I had lit upon, 
Nevertheless, a message from the dawn, 

That made me hear the wakening birds around, 
And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground, 

And feel a spirit kindred to my own; 

So that henceforth I worked no more alone; 

But glad with him, I worked as with his aid, 
And weary, sought at noon with him the shade; 



And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech 
With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach. 

v Men work together/ I told him from the heart, 
'Whether they work together or apart.' 



.26 



THE DEMIURGE'S LAUGH 

It was far in the sameness of the wood; 

I was running with joy on the Demon's trail, 
Though I knew what I hunted was no true god. 

It was just as the light was beginning to fail 
That I suddenly heard all I needed to hear: 
It has lasted me many and many a year. 

The sound was behind me instead of before, 
A sleepy sound, but mocking half, 

As of one who utterly couldn't care. 

The Demon arose from his wallow to laugh, 

Brushing the dirt from his eye as he went; 

And well I knew what the Demon meant. 

I shall not forget how his laugh rang out. 

I felt as a fool to have been so caught, 
And checked my steps to make pretence 

It was something among the leaves I sought 
(Though doubtful whether he stayed to see). 
Thereafter I sat me against a tree. 



A LINE-STORM SONG 

The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swiftj 

The road is forlorn all day, 
\Vhere a myriad snowy quartz stones lift, 

And the hoof-prints vanish away. 
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee, 

Expend their bloom in vain. 
Come over the hills and far with me, 

And be my love in the rain. 

The birds have less to say for themselves 

In the wood- world's torn despair 
Than now these numberless years the elves A 

Although they are no less there: 
All song of the woods is crushed like some 

Wild, easily shattered rose. 
Come, be my love in the wet woods, come, 

Where the boughs rain when it blows. 

There is the gale to urge behind 

And bruit our singing down, 
And the shallow waters aflutter with wind 

From which to gather your gown. 
What matter if we go clear to the west, 

And come not through dry-shod? 
For wilding brooch shall wet your breast 

The rain-fresh goldenrod. 



28 



Oh, never this whelming east wind swells 

But it seems like the sea's return 
To the ancient lands where it left the shells 

Before the age of the fern; 
And it seems like the time when after doubt 

Our love came back amain. 
Oh, come forth into the storm and rout 

And be my love in the rain. 



OCTOBER 

O hushed October morning mild, 
Thy leaves have ripened to the fall; 
To-morrow's wind, if it be wild, 
Should waste them all. 
The crows above the forest call; 
To-morrow they may form and go. 
O hushed October morning mild, 
Begin the hours of this day slow. 
Make the day seem to us less brief. 
Hearts not averse to being beguiled, 
Beguile us in the way you know. 
Release one leaf at break of day; 
At noon release another leaf; 
One from our trees, one far away. 
Retard the sun with gentle mist; 
Enchant the land with amethyst. 
Slow, slow! 

For the grapes' sake, if they were all, 
Whose leaves already are burnt with frost, 
Whose clustered fruit must else be lost 
For the grapes' sake along the wall. 



RELUCTANCE 

vJut through the fields and the woods 
And over the walls I have wended; 

I have climbed the hills of view 

And looked at the world., and descended; 

I have come by the highway home, 
And lo, it is ended. 

The leaves are all dead on the ground, 
Save those that the oak is keeping 

To ravel them one by one 

And let them go scraping and creeping 

Out over the crusted snow, 
\Vhen others are sleeping. 

And the dead leaves lie huddled and still, 
No longer blown hither and thither; 

The last lone aster is gone; 

The flowers of the witch-hazel wither; 

The heart is still aching to seek, 
But the feet question 'Whither?* 

Ah, when to the heart of man 
"Was it ever less than a treason 

To go with the drift of things, 
To yield with a grace to reason, 

And bow and accept the end 
Of a love or a season? 



North of Boston 



MENDING WALL 

Something there is that doesn't love a wall, 

That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, 

And spills the upper boulders in the sun; 

And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. 

The work of hunters is another thing: 

I have come after them and made repair 

Where they have left not one stone on a stone, 

But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, 

To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, 

No one has seen them made or heard them made 

But at spring mending-time we find them there. 

I let my neighbour know beyond the hill; 

And on a day we meet to walk the line 

And set the wall between us once again. 

We keep the wall between us as we go. 

To each the boulders *hat have fallen to each. 

And some are loaves and some so nearly balls 

We have to use a spell to make them balance: 

'Stay where you are until our backs are turned \ y 

We wear our fingers rough with handling them. 

Oh, just another kind of out-door game, 

One on a side. It comes to little more: 

There where it is we do not need the wall: 

He is all pine and I am apple orchard. 

My apple trees will never get across 

And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him. 

He only says, 'Good fences make good neighbours/ 

35 



Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder 

If I could put a notion in his head: 

'Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it 

Where there are cows? But here there are no cows. 

Before I built a wall I'd ask to know 

What I was walling in or walling out, 

And to whom I was like to give offence. 

Something there is that doesn't love a wall, 

That wants it down/ I could say ( EIves' to him, 

But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather 

He said it for himself. I see him there 

Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top 

In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed. 

He moves in darkness as it seems to me, 

Not of woods only and the shade of trees. 

He will not go behind his father's saying, 

And he likes having thought of it so well 

He says again, 'Good fences make good neighbours. 



THE MOUNTAIN 

1 he mountain held the town as in a shadow. 
I saw so much before I slept there once: 
I noticed that I missed stars in the west, 
Where its black body cut into the sky. 
Near me it seemed: I felt it like a wall 
Behind which I was sheltered from a wind. 
And yet between the town and it I found, 
When I walked forth at dawn to see new things, 
Were fields, a river, and beyond, more fields. 
The river at the time was fallen away, 
And made a widespread brawl 011 cobble-stones; 
But the signs showed what it had done in spring: 
Good grass-land gullied out, and in the grass 
Ridges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark. 
I crossed the river and swung round the mountain. 
And there I met a man who moved so slow 
With white-faced oxen in a heavy cart, 
It seemed no harm to stop him altogether. 

'What town is this?' I asked. 

'This? Lunenburg.' 

Then I was wrong: the town of my sojourn, 
Beyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain, 
But only felt at night its shadowy presence. 
* Where is your village? Very far from here?* 

45 



There is no village only scattered farms. 
We were but sixty voters last election. 
We can't in nature grow to many more: 
That thing takes all the room!' He moved his goad. 
The mountain stood there to be pointed at. 
asture ran up the side a little way, 
\nd then there was a wall of trees with trunks; 
After that only tops of trees, and cliffs 
Imperfectly concealed among the leaves. 
A dry ravine emerged from under boughs 
Into the pasture. 

'That looks like a path. 
Is that the way to reach the top from here? 
Not for this morning, but some other time: 
I must be getting back to breakfast now/ 

'I don't advise your trying from this side. 
There is no proper path, but those that have 
Been up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd's. 
That's five miles back. You can't mistake the place: 
They logged it there last winter some way up. 
Td take you, but Fm bound the other way.' 

You've never climbed it?' 

I've been on the sides, 

Deer-hunting and trout-fishing. There's a brook 
That starts up on it somewhere I've heard say 
Right on the top, tip-top a curious thing. 

46 



But what would interest you about the brook, 

It's always cold in summer, warm in winter. 

One of the great sights going is to see 

It steam in winter like an ox's breath, 

Until the bushes all along its banks 

Are inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles 

You know the kind. Then let the sun shine on it!' 

'There ought to be a view around the world 
From such a mountain if it isn't wooded 
Clear to the top.' I saw through leafy screens 
Great granite terraces in sun and shadow, 
Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up 
With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet. 
Or turn and sit on and look out and down, 
With little ferns in crevices at his elbow. 

* As to that I can't say. But there's the spring, 
Right on the summit, almost like a fountain. 
That ought to be worth seeing/ 

If it's there. 
You never saw it? 1 

'I guess there's no doubt 
About its being there. I never saw it. 
It may not be right on the very top: 
It wouldn't have to be a long way down 
To have some head of water from above, 
And a good distance down might not be noticed 

47 



By anyone who'd come a long way up. 
One time I asked a fellow climbing it 
To look and tell me later how it was.' 

' What did he say?' 

'He said there was a lake 
Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top.' 

'But a lake's different. What about the spring?' 

'He never got up high enough to see. 
That's why I don't advise your trying this side. 
He tried this side. I've always meant to go 
And look myself, but you know how it is: 
It doesn't seem so much to climb a mountain 
You've worked around the foot of all your life. 
What would I do? Go in my overalls, 
With a big stick, the same as when the cows 
Haven't come down to the bars at milking lime? 
Or with a shotgun for a stray black bear? 
'Twouldn't seem real to climb for climbing it ' 

f l shouldn't climb it if I didn't want to 

Not for the sake of climbing. What's its name^' 

'We call it Hor: I don't know if that's right/ 
Can one walk around it? Would it be too far?' 



( You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg, 
But it's as much as ever you can do, 
The boundary lines keep in so close to it. 
Hor is the township, and the township's Hor 
And a few houses sprinkled round the foot, 
Like boulders broken off the upper cliff, 
Rolled out a little farther than the rest/ 

' Warm in December, cold in June, you say?' 

'I don't suppose the water's changed at all. 
You and I know enough to know it's warm 
Compared with cold, and cold compared with warm 
But all the fun's in how you say a thing.' 

1 You've lived here all your life?' 

'Ever since Hor 

Was no bigger than a' What, I did not hear. 
He drew the oxen toward him with light touches 
Of his slim goad on nose and offside flank, 
Gave them their marching orders and was moving, 



A HUNDRED COLLARS 

Lancaster bore him such a little town, 

Such a great man. It doesn't see him often 

Of late years, though he keeps the old homestead 

And sends the children down there with their mother 

To run wild in the summer a little wild. 

Sometimes he joins them for a day or two 

And sees old friends he somehow can't get near. 

They meet him in the general store at night, 

Pre-occupied with formidable mail, 

Rifling a printed letter as he talks. 

They seem afraid. He wouldn't have it so: 

Though a great scholar, he's a democrat, 

If not at heart, at least on principle. 

Lately when coming up to Lancaster, 

His train being late, he missed another train 

And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction 

After eleven o'clock at night. Too tired 

To think of sitting such an ordeal out, 

He turned to the hotel to find a bed. 

'No room/ the night clerk said. 'Unless' 

Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps 
And cars that shock and rattle and one hotel. 

'You say "unless."' 
50 



'Unless you wouldn't mind 
Sharing a room with someone else.' 

'Who is it?' 



man. 



'So I should hope. What kind of man?' 

'I know him: he's all right. A man's a man. 
Separate beds, of course, you understand.' 
The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on. 

Who's that man sleeping in the office chair? 
Has he had the refusal of my chance?' 

'He was afraid of being robbed or murdered. 
What do you say?' 

Til have to have a bed.' 

The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs 
And down a narrow passage full of doors, 
At the last one of which he knocked and entered. 
'Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your room.' 

'Show him this way. I'm not afraid of him. 
I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself.' 



The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot. 
'This will be yours. Good-night,' he said, and went 

'Lafe was the name, I think?' 

'Yes, Layfayette. 
You got it the first time. And yours?' 

'Magoon,. 
Doctor Magoon.' 

'A Doctor?' 

'Well, a teacher/'' 

'Professor Square-the-circle-till-you're-tired? 
Hold on, there's something I don't think of now 
That I had on my mind to ask the first 
Man that knew anything I happened in with. 
I'll ask you later don't let me forget it.' 

The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away. 

A man? A brute. Naked above the waist, 

He sat there creased and shining in the light, 

Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt: 

'I'm moving into a size-larger shirt. 

I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it. 

I just found what the matter was to-night: 

I've been a-choking like a nursery tree 

When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag. 

52 



I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having. 
'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back, 
Not liking to own up I'd grown a size. 
Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?' 

The Doctor caught his throat convulsively. 
v Oh ah fourteen fourteen. ' 

'Fourteen! You say so! 
I can remember when I wore fourteen. 
And come to think I must have back at home 
More than a hundred collars, size fourteen. 
Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have 

them. 
They're yours and welcome; let me send them to 

you. 

What makes you stand there on one leg like that? 
You're not much furtherer than where Kike left you. 
You act as if you wished you hadn't come. 
Sit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous/ 

The Doctor made a subdued dash for it, 
And propped himself at bay against a pillow. 

'Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed 
You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off.' 

'Don't touch me, please I say, don't touch me, 

please. 
I'll not be put to bed by you, my man.' 

53 



'Just as you say. Have it your own way then. 
"My man" is it? You talk like a professor. 
Speaking of who's afraid of who, however, 
I'm thinking I have more to lose than you 
If anything should happen to be wrong. 
Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat I 
Let's have a show down as an evidence 
Of good faith. There is ninety dollars. 
Come, if you're not afraid/ 

f Tm not afraid. 
There's five: that's all I carry.' 

1 can search you? 

Where are you moving over to? Stay still. 
You'd better tuck your money under you 
And sleep on it the way I always do 
When I'm with people I don't trust at night.' 

'Will you believe me if I put it there 

Right on the counterpanethat I do trust you?' 

'You'd say so, Mister Man. I'm a collector. 
My ninety isn't mine you won't think that. 
I pick it up a dollar at a time 
All round the country for the Weekly News, 
Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News?' 

'Known it since I was young.' 
54 



'Then you know me. 
Now we are getting on together talking. 
I'm sort of Something for it at the front. 
My business is to find what people want: 
They pay for it, and so they ought to have it. 
Fairbanks, he says to mehe's editor 
"Feel out the public sentiment" he says. 
A good deal comes on me when all is said. 
The only trouble is we disagree 
In politics: I'm Vermont Democrat 
You know what that is, sort of double-dyed; 
The News has always been Republican. 
Fairbanks, he says to me, "Help us this year," 
Meaning by us their ticket. "No," I says, 
"I can't and won't. You've been in long enough: 
It's time you turned around and boosted us. 
You'll have to pay me more than ten a week 
If Fm expected to elect Bill Taft. 
I doubt if I could do it anyway." ' 

1 You seem to shape the paper's policy/ 

* You see I'm in with everybody, know 'em all. 
I almost know their farms as well as they do/ 

' You drive around? It must be pleasant work/ 

It's business, but I can't say it's not fun. 
What I like best's the lay of different farms, 

55 



Coming out on them from a stretch of woods, 

Or over a hill or round a sudden corner. 

I like to find folks getting out in spring, 

Raking the dooryard, working near the house. 

Later they get out further in the fields. 

Everything's shut sometimes except the barn; 

The family's all away in some back meadow. 

There's a hay load a-coming when it comes. 

And later still they all get driven in: 

The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches 

Stripped to bare ground, the maple trees 

To whips and poles. There's nobody about. 

The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking. 

And I lie back and ride. I take the reins 

Only when someone's coming, and the mare 

Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go. 

I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one. 

She's got so she turns in at every house 

As if she had some sort of curvature, 

No matter if I have no errand there. 

She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am. 

It's seldom I get down except for meals, though. 

Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep, 

All in a family row down to the youngest.' 

'One would suppose they might not be as glad 
To see you as you are to see them/ 

'Oh, 
Because I want their dollar? I don't want 

56 



Anything they've not got. I never dun. 
I'm there, and they can pay me if they like. 
I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by. 
Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink. 
I drink out of the bottle not your style. 
Mayn't I offer you?' 

'No, no, no, thank you/ 

'Just as you say. Here's looking at you then. 
And now I'm leaving you a little while. 
You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps 
Lie down let yourself go and get some sleep. 
Bnt first let's see what was I going to ask you? 
Those collars who shall I address them to, 
Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?' 

* Really, friend, I can't let you. You may need them.* 
'Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style.' 
'But really I I have so many collars.' 

'I don't know who I rather would have have them. 
They're only turning yellow where they are. 
But you're the doctor as the saying is. 
I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me: 
I've just begun the night. You get some sleep. 
I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door 
When I come back so you'll know who it is. 

57 



There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people. 
I don't want you should shoot me in the head. 
What am I doing carrying off this bottle? 
There now, you get some sleep/ 

He shut the door. 
The Doctor slid a little down the pillow. 



Against the lounge beside it, though I doubt 

If such unlifelike lines kept power to stir 

Anything in her after all the years. 

He fell at Gettysburg or Fredericksburg, 

I ought to know it makes a difference which: 

Fredericksburg wasn't Gettysburg, of course. 

But what I'm getting to is how forsaken 

A little cottage this has always seemed; 

Since she went more than ever, but before 

I don't mean altogether by the lives 

That had gone out of it, the father first, 

Then the two sons, till she was left alone. 

(Nothing could draw her after those two sons. 

She valued the considerate neglect 

She had at some costtaught them after years.) 

I meanby the woilZ^'sJhiayjngpasscd it by"" 

As we^almost got by this afternoon^ 

It always seems to me a sort of mark 

To measure how far fifty years have brought us. 

Why not sit down if you are in no haste? 

These doorsteps seldom have a visitor. 

The warping boards pull out their own old nails 

With none to tread and put them in their place. 

She had her own idea of things, the old lady. 

And she liked talk. She had seen Garrison 

And Whittier, and had her story of them. 

One wasn't long in learning that she thought 

Whatever else the Civil War was for, 

It wasn't just to keep the States together, 

Nor just to free the slaves, though it did both. 

65 



She wouldn't have believed those ends enough 
To have given outright for them all she gave. 
Her giving somehow touched the principle 
That all men are created free and equal. 
And to hear her quaint phrasesso removed 
From the world's view to-day of all those things. 
That's a hard mystery of Jefferson's. 
What did he mean? Of course the easy way 
Is to decide it simply isn't true. 
It may not be. I heard a fellow say so. 
But never mind, the Welshman got it planted 
Where it will trouble us a thousand years. 
Each age will have to reconsider it. 
You couldn't tell her what the West was saying, 
And what the South to her serene belief. 
She had some art of hearing and yet not 
Hearing the latter wisdom of the world. 
White was the only race she ever knew. 
Black she had scarcely seen, and yellow never. 
But how could they be made so very unlike 
By the same hand working in the same stuff? 
She had supposed the war decided that. 
What are you going to do with such a person? 
Strange how such innocence gets its own way. 
I shouldn't be surprised if in this world 
It were the force that would at last prevail. 
Do you know but for her there was a time 
When to please younger members of the church, 
Or rather say non-members in the church, 
Whom we all have to think of nowadays, 

66 



I would have changed the Creed a very little? 

Not that she ever had to ask me not to; 

It never got so far as that; but the bare thought 

Of her old tremulous bonnet in the pew, 

And of her half asleep was too much for me. 

Why, I might wake her up and startle her. 

It was the words "descended into Hades' ' 

That seemed too pagan to our liberal youth. 

You know they suffered from a general onslaught. 

And well, if they weren't true why keep right on 

Saying them like the heathen? We could drop them. 

Only there was the bonnet in the pew. 

Such a phrase couldn't have meant much to her. 

But suppose she had missed it from the Creed 

As a child misses the unsaid Good-night, 

And falls asleep with heartache how should I feel? 

Fm just as glad she made me keep hands off, 

For, dear me, why abandon a belief 

Merely because it ceases to be true. 

Cling to it long enough, and not a doubt 

It will turn true again, for so it goes. 

Most of the change we think we see in life 

Is due to truths being in and out of favour. 

As I sit here, and oftentimes, I wish 

I could be monarch of a desert land 

I could devote and dedicate forever 

To the truths we keep coming back and back to. 

So desert it would have to be, so walled 

By mountain ranges half in summer snow, 

No one would covet it or think it worth 

67 



The pains of conquering to force change on. 
Scattered oases where men dwelt, but mostly 
Sand dunes held loosely in tamarisk 
Blown over and over themselves in idleness. 
Sand grains should sugar in the natal dew 
The babe born to the desert, the sand storm 
Retard mid-waste my cowering caravans- 
There are bees in this wall. 7 He struck the clapboards, 
Fierce heads looked out; small bodies pivoted. 
We rose to go. Sunset blazed on the windows. 



68 



BLUEBERRIES 1 

You ought to have seen what I saw on my way 
To the village, through Patterson's pasture to-day: 
Blueberries as big as the end of your thumb, 
Real sky-blue, and heavy, and ready to drum 
In the cavernous pail of the first one to come! 
And all ripe together, not some of them green 
And some of them ripe! You ought to have seenP 

'I don't know what part of the pasture you mean.' 

< You know where they cut off the woods let me see~ 

It was two years ago or no! can it be 

No longer than that? and the following fall 

The fire ran and burned it all up but the wall.' 

'Why, there hasn't been time for the bushes to grow % 
That's always the way with the blueberries, though: 
There may not have been the ghost of a sign 
Of them anywhere under the shade of the pine, 
But get the pine out of the way, you may burn 
The pasture all over until not a fern 
Or grass-blade is left, not to mention a stick, 
And presto, they're up all around you as thick 
And hard to explain as a conjuror's trick/ 

'It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit. 
I taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot. 



And after all really they're ebony skinned: 

The blue's but a mist from the breath of the wind, 

A tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand, 

And less than the tan with which pickers are tanned/ 

'Does Patterson know what he has, do you think?' 

'He may and not care and so leave the chewink 
To gather them for him you know what he is. 
He won't make the fact that they're rightfully his 
An excuse for keeping us other folk out/ 

'I wonder you didn't see Loren about.' 

'The best of it was that I did. Do you know, 

[ was just getting through what the field had to show 

And over the wall and into the road, 

When who should come by, with a democrat-load 

Of all the young chattering Lorens alive, 

But Loren, the fatherly, out for a drive/ 

'He saw you, then? What did he do? Did he frown?' 

'He just kept nodding his head up and down. 
You know how politely he always goes by. 
But he thought a big thought I could tell by his eye 
Which being expressed, might be this in effect: 
!< I have left those there berries, I shrewdly suspect, 
To ripen too long. I am greatly to blame." ' 

70 



'He's a thriftier person than some I could name/ 

'He seems to be thrifty; and hasn't he need, 

With the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed? 

He has brought them all up on wild berries, they say, 

Like birds. They store a great many away. 

They eat them the year round, and those they don't eat 

They sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet/ 

'Who cares what they say? It's a nice way to live, 
Just taking what Nature is willing to give, 
Not forcing her hand with harrow and plow.' 

'I wish you had seen his perpetual bow 

And the air of the youngsters! Not one of them turned, 

And they looked so solemn-absurdly concerned/ 

'I wish I knew half what the flock of them know 
Of where all the berries and other things grow, 
Cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top 
Of the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they 

will crop. 

I met them one day and each had a flower 
Stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower; 
Some strange kindthey told me it hadn't a name/ 

Tve told you how once not long after we came, 
I almost provoked poor Loren to mirth 
By going to him of all people on earth 

71 



To ask if he knew any fruit to be had 
For the picking. The rascal, he said he'd be glad 
To tell if he knew. But the year had been bad. 
There had been some berries but those were all gone. 
He didn't say where they had been. He went on: 
"I'm sure I'm sure" as polite as could be. 
He spoke to his wife in the door, "Let me see, 
Mame, we don't know any good berrying place?" 
It was all he could do to keep a straight face.' 

'If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him, 
He'll find he's mistaken. See here, for a whim, 
We'll pick in the Pattersons' pasture this year. 
We'll go in the morning, that is, if it's clear, 
And the sun shines out warm: the vines must be wet. 
It's so long since I picked I almost forget 
How we used to pick berries: we took one look round. 
Then sank out of sight like trolls underground, 
And saw nothing more of each other, or heard, 
Unless when you said I was keeping a bird 
Away from its nest, and I said it was you. 
"Well, one of us is." For complaining it flew 
Around and around us. And then for a while 
We picked, till I feared you had wandered a mile, 
And I thought I had lost you. I lifted a shout 
Too loud for the distance you were, it turned out, 
For when you made answer, your voice was as low 
fas talking you stood up beside me, you know/ 

( We ska'n't have the place to ourselves to enjoy 
72 



Not likely, when all the young Lorens deploy. 
They'll be there lo-morrow, or even to-night. 
They won't be too friendly they may be polite 
To people they look on as having no right 
To pick where they're picking. But we won't com- 
plain. 

You ought to have seen how it looked in the rain, 
The fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves, 
Like two kinds of jewels, a vision for thieves.' 



73 



A SERVANT TO SERVANTS 

I didn't make you know how glad I was 

To have you come and camp here on our land. 

I promised myself to get down some day 

And see the way you lived, but I don't know! 

With a houseful of hungry men to feed 

I guess you'd find. ... It seems to me 

I can't express my feelings any more 

Than I can raise my voice or want to lift 

My hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to). 

Did ever you feel so? I hope you never. 

It's got so I don't even know for sure 

Whether I am glad, sorry, or anything. 

There's nothing but a voice-like left inside 

That seems to tell me how I ought to feel, 

And would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong. 

You take the lake. I look and look at it. 

I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water. 

I stand and make myself repeat out loud 

The advantages it has, so long and narrow, 

Like a deep piece of some old running river 

Cut short off at both ends. It lies five miles 

Straight away through the mountain notch 

From the sink window where I wash the plates, 

And all our storms come up toward the house, 

Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and 

whiter. 
It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit 

74 



To step outdoors and take the water dazzle 
A sunny morning, or take the rising wind 
About my face and body and through my wrapper, 
When a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den, 
And a cold chill shivered across the lake. 
I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water, 
Our Willoughby! How did you hear of it? 
I expect, though, everyone's heard of it. 
In a book about ferns? Listen to that! 
You let things more like feathers regulate 
Your going and coming. And you like it here? 
I can see how you might. But I don't know! 
It would be different if more people came, 
For then there would be business. As it is, 
The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them, 
Sometimes we don't. We've a good piece of shore 
That ought to be worth something, and may yet. 
But I don't count on it as much as Len. 
He looks on the bright side of everything, 
Including me. He thinks I'll be all right 
With doctoring. But it's not medicine- 
Lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so- 
ft's rest I want there, I have said it out 
From cooking meals for hungry hired men 
And washing dishes after them from doing 
Things over and over that just won't stay done. 
By good rights I ought not to have so much 
Put on me, but there seems no other way. 
Len says one steady pull more ought to do it. 
He says the best way out is always through. 

75 



And I agree to that, or in so far 
As that I can see no way out but through 
Leastways for me and then they'll be convinced. 
It's not that Len don't want the best for me. 
It was his plan our moving over in 
Beside the lake from where that day I showed you 
We used to live ten miles from anywhere. 
We didn't change without some sacrifice, 
But Len went at it to make up the loss. 
His work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun, 
But he works when he works as hard as I do- 
Though there's small profit in comparisons. 
(Women and men will make them all the same. ) 
But work ain't all. Len undertakes too much. 
He's into everything in town. This year 
It's highways, and he's got too many men 
Around him to look after that make waste. 
They take advantage of him shamefully, 
And proud, too, of themselves for doing so. 
We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings, 
Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk 
While I fry their bacon. Much they care! 
No more put out in what they do or say 
Than if I wasn't in the room at all. 
Coming and going all the time, they are: 
I don't learn what their names are, let alone 
Their characters, or whether they are safe 
To have inside the house with doors unlocked. 
Fm not afraid of them, though, if they're not 
Afraid of me. There's two can play at that. 



I have my fancies: it runs in the family. 
My father's brother wasn't right. They kept him 
Locked up for years back there at the old farm. 
I've been away once yes, IVe been away. 
The State Asylum. I was prejudiced; 
I wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there; 
You know the old ideathe only asylum 
Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford, 
Rather than send their folks to such a place, 
Kept them at home; and it does seem more human. 
But it's not so: the place is the asylum. 
There they have every means proper to do with, 
And you aren't darkening other people's lives- 
Worse than no good to them, and they no good 
To you in your condition; you can't know 
Affection or the want of it in that state. 
I've heard too much of the old-fashioned way. 
My father's brother, he went mad quite young. 
Some thought he had been bitten by a dog, 
Because his violence took on the form 
Of carrying his pillow in his teeth; 
But it's more likely he was crossed in love, 
Or so the story goes. It was some girl. 
Anyway all he talked about was love. 
They soon saw he would do someone a mischief 
If he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended 
In father's building him a sort of cage, 
Or room within a room, of hickory poles, 
Like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling. 
A narrow passage all the way around. 



Anything they put in for furniture 

He'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on. 

So they made the place comfortable with straw, 

Like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences. 

Of course they had to feed him without dishes. 

They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded 

With his clothes on his arm all of his clothes. 

Cruelit sounds. I 'spose they did the best 

They knew. And just when he was at the height, 

Father and mother married, and mother came, 

A bride, to help take care of such a creature, 

And accommodate her young life to his. 

That was what marrying father meant to her. 

She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful 

By his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout 

Until the strength was shouted out of him, 

And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion. 

He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bowstring, 

And let them go and make them twang until 

His hands had worn them smooth as any oxbow. 

And then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play 

The only fun he had. I've heard them say, though, 

They found a way to put a stop to it. 

He was before my time I never saw him; 

But the pen stayed exactly as it was 

There in the upper chamber in the ell, 

A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter. 

I often think of tJig^nioathJiickof.y, bars. 

It got so I would say you know, half fooling 

'It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail' 

Just as you will till it becomes a habit. 

78 



No wonder L was glad to get away. 
Mind you, I waited till Len said the word. 
I didn't want the blame if things went wrong. 
I was glad though ; no end, when we moved out, 
And I looked to be happy, and I was, 
As I said, for a while but I don't know! 
Somehow the change wore out like a prescription. 
And there's more to it than just window-views 
And living by a lake. I'm past such help 
Unless Len took the notion, which he won't, 
And I won't ask himit's not sure enough. 
I 'spose I've got to go the road Fm going: 
Other folks have to, and why shouldn't I? 
T almost think if I could do like you, 
Drop everything and live out on the ground- 
But it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it, 
Or a long rain. I should soon get enough, 
And be glad of a good roof overhead. 
Fve lain awake thinking of you, Fll warrant, 
More than you have yourself, some of these nights. 
The wonder was the tents weren't snatched away 
From over you as you lay in your beds. 
I haven't courage for a risk like that. 
Bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work, 
But the thing of it is, I need to be kept. 
There's work enough to do there's always that; 
But behind' s behind. The worst that you can do 
Is set me back a little more behind. 
I sha'n't catch up in this world, anyway. 
I'd rather you'd not go unless you must. 



AFTER APPLE-PICKING 

IVly long two-pointed ladder 's sticking through a 

tree 

Toward heaven still, 
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill 
Beside it, and there may be two or three 
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough. 
But I am done with apple-picking now. 
Essence of winter sleep is on the night, 
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off. 
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight 
I got from looking through a pane of glass 
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough 
And held against the world of hoary grass. 
It melted, and I let it fall and break. 
But I was well 

Upon my way to sleep before it fell, 
And I could tell 

What form my dreaming was about to take. 
Magnified apples appear and disappear, 
Stem end and blossom end, 
And every fleck of russet showing clear. 
My instep arch not only keeps the ache, 
It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round. 
I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend. 
And I keep hearing from the cellar bin 
The rumbling sound 
Of load on load of apples coming in. 

80 



For I have had too much 

Of apple-picking: I am overtired 

Of the great harvest I myself desired. 

There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch, 

Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall. 

For all 

That struck the earth, 

No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble, 

Went surely to the cider-apple heap 

As of no worth. 

One can see what will trouble 

This sleep of mine, whatever sleep itj. 

Were he not gone, 

The woodchuck could say whether it's like his 

Long sleep, as I describe its coming on, 

Or just some human sleep. 



81 



THE CODE 

1 here were three in the meadow by the brook 
Gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay, 
With an eye always lifted toward the west 
Where an irregular sun-bordered cloud 
Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger 
Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly 
One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground, 
Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed. 
The town-bred farmer failed to understand. 

* What is there wrong?' 

'Something you just now said/ 
' What did I say?' 

* About our taking pains/ 

'To cock the hay? because it's going to shower? 
I said that more than half an hour ago. 
I said it to myself as much as you/ 

'You didn't know. But James is one big fool. 
He thought you meant to find fault with his work. 
That's what the average farmer would have meant. 
James would take time, of course, to chew it over 
Before he acted: he's just got round to act/ 

82 



'He is a fool if that's the way he takes me.' 

'Don't let it bother you. You've found out something 
The hand that knows his business won't be told 
To do work better 01 fasterthose two things. 
I'm as particular as anyone: 
Most likely I'd have served you just the same. 
But I know you don't understand our ways. 
You were just talking what was in your mind, 
What was in all our minds, and you weren't hinting. 
Tell you a story of what happened once: 
I was up here in Salem at a man's 
Named Sanders with a gang of four or five 
Doing the haying. No one liked the boss. 
He was one of the kind sports call a spider, 
All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy 
From a humped body nigh as big's a biscuit 
But work! that man could work, especially 
If by so doing he could get more work 
Out of his hired help. I'm not denying 
He was hard on himself. I couldn't find 
That he kept any hours not for himself. 
Daylight and lantern-light were one to him: 
I've heard him pounding in the barn all night. 
But what he liked was someone to encourage. 
Them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind 
And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing- 
Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off 
I'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks 
(We call that bulling). I'd been watching him. 

83 



So when he paired off with me in the hayfield 

To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble. 

I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders 

Combed it down with a rake and says, "O. K." 

Everything went well till we reached the barn 

With a big jag to empty in a bay. 

You understand that meant the easy job 

For the man up on top of throwing down 

The hay and rolling it off wholesale, 

Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting. 

You wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging 

Under those circumstances, would you now? 

But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands, 

And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit, 

Shouts like an army captain, "Let her come!" 

Thinks I, D'ye mean it? " What was that you said?" 

I asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake, 

"Did you say, Let her come?" "Yes, let her come." 

He said it over, but he said it softer. 

Never you say a thing like that to a man, 

Not if he values what he is. God, I'd as soon 

Murdered him as left out his middle name. 

Fd built the load and knew right where to find it. 

Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for 

Like meditating, and then I just dug in 

And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots. 

I looked over the side once in the dust 

And caught sight of him treading- water-like, 

Keeping his head above. "Damn ye," I says, 

84 



"That gets ye!" He squeaked like a squeezed rat. 

That was the last I saw or heard of him. 

I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off. 

As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck, 

And sort of waiting to be asked about it, 

One of the boys sings out, " Where's the old man?" 

"I left him in the barn under the hay. 

If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out." 

They realized from the way I swobbed my neck 

More than was needed something must be up. 

They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was. 

They told me afterward. First they forked hay, 

A lot of it, out into the barn floor. 

Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle. 

I guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple 

Before I buried him, or I couldn't have managed. 

They excavated more. "Go keep his wife 

Out of the barn." Someone looked in a window, 

And curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen 

Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet 

Against the stove, the hottest day that summer. 

He looked so clean disgusted from behind 

There was no one that dared to stir him up, 

Or let him know that he was being looked at. 

Apparently I hadn't buried him 

(I may have knocked him down); but my just trying 

To bury him had hurt his dignity. 

He had gone to the house so's not to meet me. 

He kept away from us all afternoon. 

85 



We tended to his hay. We saw him out 

After a while picking peas in his garden: 

He couldn't keep away from doing something.' 

* Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?' 

No! and yet I d'jn't know it's hard to say, 
I went about to kill him fair enough.' 

' You took an awkward way. Did he discharge you? 1 
4 Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right/ 



86 



THE GENERATIONS OF MEN 

A. governor it was proclaimed this time, 
When all who would come seeking in 

Hampshire 
Ancestral memories might come together. 
And those of the name Stark gathered in Bow, 
A rock-strewn town where farming has fallefrofl, 
And sprout-lands flourish where the axe has gone. 
Someone had literally run to earth 
In an old cellar hole in a by-road 
The origin of all the family there. 
Thence they were sprung, so numerous a tribe 
That now not all the houses left in town 
Made shift to shelter them without the help 
Of here and there a tent in grove and orchard. 
They were at Bow, but that was not enough: 
Nothing would do butthey must fix a day 
To stand together on the crater's verge 
That turned them on the world, and try to fathom 
The past and get some strangeness out of it. 
But rain spoiled all. The day began uncertain, 
With clouds low trailing and moments of rain that 

misted. 

The young folk held some hope out to each other 
Till well toward noon when the storm settled down 
With a swish in the grass. 'What if the others 
Are there/ they said. 'It isn't going to rain/ 
Only one from a farm not far away 

87 



Strolled thither, not expecting he would find 

Anyone else, but out of idleness. 

One, and one other, yes, for there were two. 

The second round the curving hillside road 

Was a girl; and she halted some way off 

To reconnoitre, and then made up her mind 

At least to pass by and see who he was, 

And perhaps hear some word about the weather. 

This was some Stark she didn't know. He nodded. 

'No fete to-day/ he said. 

'It looks that way/ 

She swept the heavens, turning on her heel. 
'I only idled down/ 

'I idled down/ 

Provision there had been for just such meeting 
Of stranger cousins, in a family tree 
Drawn on a sort of passport with the branch 
Of the one bearing it done in detail- 
Some zealous one's laborious device. 
She made a sudden movement toward her bodice, 
As one who clasps her heart. They laughed together. 
'Stark?' he inquired. 'No matter for the proof/ 

'Yes, Stark. And you?' 

Tm Stark.' He drew his passport. 
68 



( You know we might not be and still be cousins: 

The town is full of Chases, Lowes, and Baileys, 

All claiming some priority in Starkness. 

My mother was a Lane, yet might have married 

Anyone upon earth and still her children 

Would have been Starks, and doubtless here to-day.' 

( You riddle with your genealogy 
Like a Viola. I don't follow you/ 

*I only mean my mother was a Stark 
Several times over, and by marrying father 
No more than brought us back into the name/ 

'One ought not to be thrown into confusion 

By a plain statement of relationship, 

But I own what you say makes my head spin. 

You take my card you seem so good at such things 

And see if you can reckon our cousinship. 

Why not take seats here on the cellar wall 

And dangle feet among the raspberry vines?* 

'Under the shelter of the family tree/ 
'Just so that ought to be enough protection/ 
'Not from the rain. I think it's going to rain/ 
'It's raining/ 

89 



'No, it's misting; let's be fair. 
Does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes?' 

The situation was like this: the road 

Bowed outward on the mountain half-way up, 

And disappeared and ended not far off. 

No one went home that way. The only house 

Beyond where they were was a shattered secdpod. 

And below roared a brook hidden in trees, 

The sound of which was silence for the place. 

This he sat listening to till she gave judgment. 

'On father's side, it seems, we're let me see' 
'Don't be too technical. You have three cards.' 

Tour cards, one yours, three mine, one for each 
branch 
Of the Stark family I'm a member of.' 

'D'you know a person so related to herself 
Is supposed to be mad.' 

*I may be mad/ 

< You look so, sitting out here in the rain 
Studying genealogy with me 
You never saw before. What will we come to 
With all this pride of ancestry, we Yankees? 
I think we're all mad. Tell me why we're here 

90 



Drawn into town about this cellar hole 
Like wild geese on a lake before a storm? 
What do we see in such a hole, I wonder/ 

'The Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc, 

Which means The Seven Caves that We Came out ot. 

This is the pit from which we Starks were digged/ 

'You must be learned. That's what you see in it?' 
'And what do you see?' 

' Yes, what do I see? 
First let me look. I see raspberry vines' 

'Oh, if you're going to use your eyes, just hear 

What / see. It's a little, little boy, 

As pale and dim as a match flame in the sun; 

He's groping in the cellar after jam, 

He thinks it's dark and it's flooded with daylight/ 

'He's nothing. Listen. When I lean like this 
I can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly, 
With his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug- 
Bless you, it isn't Grandsir Stark, it's Granny, 
But the pipe's there and smoking and the jug. 
She's after cider, the old girl, she's thirsty; 
Here's hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely/ 

'Tell me about her. Does she look like me? 1 

91 



'She should, shouldn't she, you're so many times 
Over descended from her. I believe 
She does look like you. Stay the way you are. 
The nose is just the same, and so's the chin- 
Making allowance, making due allowance.' 

'You poor, dear, great, great, great, great Granny!' 
'See that you get her greatness right. Don't stint her/ 

' Yes, it's important, though you think it isn't. 
I won't be teased. But see how wet I am.' 

1 Yes, you must go; we can't stay here for ever. 

But wait until I give you a hand up. 

A bead of silver water more or less 

Strung on your hair won't hurt your summer looks 

I wanted to try something with the noise 

That the brook raises in the empty valley. 

We have seen visions now consult the voices. 

Something I must have learned riding in trains 

When I was young. I used to use the roar 

To set the voices speaking out of it, 

Speaking or singing, and the band-music playing 

Perhaps you have the art of what I mean. 

I've never listened in among the sounds 

That a brook makes in such a wild descent. 

It ought to give a purer oracle.' 



'It's as you throw a picture on a screen: 

The meaning of it all is out of you; 

The voices give you what you wish to hear.' 

'Strangely, it's anything they wish to give/ 

'Then I don't know. It must be strange enough. 

I wonder if it's not your make-believe. 

What do you think you're like to hear to-day?' 

'From the sense of our having been together 
But why take time for what I'm like to hear? 
I'll tell you what the voices really say. 
You will do very well right where you are 
A little longer. I mustn't feel too hurried, 
Or I can't give myself to hear the voices.' 

'Is this some trance you are withdrawing into?' 
'You must be very still; you mustn't talk/ 
Til hardly breathe/ 

'The voices seem to say' 
Tin waiting/ 

'Don't! The voices seem to say: 
Call her Nausicaa, the unafraid 
Of an acquaintance made adventurously/ 

93 



'I let you say thaton consideration.' 

'I don't see very well how you can help it. 
You want the truth. I speak but by the voices. 
You sec they know I haven't had your name, 
Though what a name should matter between us 

'I shall suspect-' 

'Be good. The voices say: 
Call her Nausicaa, and take a timber 
That you shall find lies in the cellar charred 
Among the raspberries, and hew and shape it 
For a door-sill or other corner piece 
In a new cottage on the ancient spot. 
The life is not yet all gone out of it. 
And come and make your summer dwelling here, 
And perhaps she will come., still unafraid, 
And sit before you in the open door 
With flowers in her lap until they fade, 
But not come in across the sacred sill' 

'I wonder where your oracle is tending. 
You can see that there's something wrong with it, 
Or it would speak in dialect. Whose voice 
Does it purport to speak in? Not old Grandsir's 
Nor Granny's, surely. Call up one of them. 
They have best right to be heard in this place/ 



94 



'You seem so partial to our great-grandmother 
(Nine times removed. Correct me if I err.) 
You will be likely to regard as sacred 
Anything she may say. But let me warn you, 
Folks in her day were given to plain speaking. 
You think you'd best tempt her at such a time?' 

c lt rests with us always to cut her off/ 

1 Well then, it's Granny speaking: "I dunnow! 

Mebbe I'm wrong to take it as I do. 

There ain't no names quite like the old ones 

though, 

Nor never will be to my way of thinking. 
One mustn't bear too hard on the new comers, 
But there's a dite too many of them for comfort. 
I should feel easier if I could see 
More of the salt wherewith they're to be salted. 
Son, you do as you're told! You take the timber- 
It's as sound as the day when it was cut 
And begin over" There, she'd better stop. 
You can see what is troubling Granny, though. 
But don't you think we sometimes make too much 
Of the old stock? What counts is the ideals, 
And those will bear some keeping still about.' 

'I can see we are going to be good friends.' 



'I like your "going to be." You said just now 
It's going to rain/ 



95 



'I know, and it was raining. 
I let you say all that. But I must go now.' 

* You let me say it? on consideration? 
How shall we say good-bye in such a case?' 

'How shall we?' 

* Will you leave the way to me?' 

'No, I don't trust your eyes. You've said enough. 
Now give me your hand up. Pick me that flower.' 

' Where shall we meet again?' 

' No where but here 
Once more before we meet elsewhere.' 

'In rain?' 

'It ought to be in rain. Sometime in rain. 
In rain to-morrow, shall we, if it rains? 
But if we must, in sunshine.' So she went. 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



1 let myself in at the kitchen door. 

It's you/ she said. 'I can't get up. Forgive mt 
Not answering your knock. I can no more 
Let people in than I can keep them out. 
I'm getting too old for my size, I tell them. 
My fingers are about all I've the use of 
So's to take any comfort. I can sew: 
I help out with this beadwork what I can/ 

'That's a smart pair of pumps you're beading there. 
Who are they for?' 

' You mean? oh, for some miss. 
I can't keep track of other people's daughters. 
Lord, if I were to dream of everyone 
Whose shoes I primped to dance in!' 

'And where's John? 1 

'Haven't you seen him? Strange what set you off 
To come to his house when he's gone to yours. 
You can't have passed each other. I know what: 
He must have changed his mind and gone to Gar* 

land's. 

He won't be long in that case. You can wait. 
Though what good you can be, or anyone-- 
It's gone so far. You've heard? Estelle's run off.' 

97 



'Yes, what's it all about? When did she go? 7 
'Two weeks since/ 

'She's in earnest, it appears/ 

Tm sure she won't come back. She's hiding some- 
where. 

I don't know where myself. John thinks I do. 
He thinks I only have to say the word, 
And she'll come back. But, bless you, I'm her mother 
I can't talk to her, and, Lord, if I could!' 

'It will go hard with John. What will he do? 
He can't find anyone to take her place.' 

'Oh, if you ask me that, what will he do? 

He gets some sort of bakeshop meals together, 

With me to sit and tell him everything, 

What's wanted and how much and where it is. 

But when I'm gone of course I can't stay here: 

EstenVs to take me when she's settled down. 

He and I only hinder one another. 

I tell them they can't get me through the door, 

though: 

I've been built in here like a big church organ. 
We've been here fifteen years.' 

'That's a long time 
To live together and then pull apart. 

98 



How do you see him living when you're gone? 
Two of you out will leave an empty house/ 

1 don't just see him living many years, 

Left here with nothing but the furniture. 

I hate to think of the old place when we're gonfc, 

With the brook going by below the yard, 

And no one here but hens blowing about. 

If he could sell the place, but then, he can't: 

No one will ever live on it again. 

It's too run down. This is the last of it. 

What I think he will do, is let things smash. 

He'll sort of swear the time away. He's awful! 

I never saw a man let family troubles 

Make so much difference in his man's affairs. 

He's just dropped everything. He's like a child. 

I blame his being brought up by his mother. 

He's got hay down that's been rained on three times. 

He hoed a little yesterday for me: 

I thought the growing things would do him good. 

Something went wrong. I saw him throw the hoe 

Sky-high with both hands. I can see it now 

Come here I'll show you in that apple tree. 

That's no way for a man to do at his age: 

He's fifty-five, you know, if he's a day.' 

'Aren't you afraid of him? What's that gun for?' 

'Oh, that's been there for hawks since chicken-time. 
John Hall touch me! Not if he knows his friends. 

99 



I'll say that for him ; John's no threatener 
Like some men folk. No one's afraid of him; 
All is, he's made up his mind not to stand 
What he has got to stand.' 

' Where is Estelle? 

Couldn't one talk to her? What does she say? 
You say you don't know where she is.' 

v Nor wanttol 

She thinks if it was bad to live with him, 
It must be right to leave him.' 

1 Which is wrong!' 
'Yes, but he should have married her.' 

'I know.' 

J The strain's been too much for her fjl these years: 

[ can't explain it any other way. 

It's different with a man, at least with John: 

He knows he's kinder than the run of men. 

Better than married ought to be as good 

As married that's what he has always said. 

t know the way he's felt but all the same!' 

1 wonder why he doesn't marry her 
And end it.' 



10O 



'Too late now: she wouldn't have him. 
He's given her time to think of something else. 
That's his mistake. The dear knows my interest 
Has been to keep the thing from breaking up. 
This is a good home: I don't ask for better. 
But whenl' ve said, ' ' Why shouldn't they be married/*' 
He'd say, " Why should they?" no more words that 
that.' 

'And after all why should they? John's been fair 
I take it. What was his was always hers. 
There was no quarrel about property.' 

'Reason enough, there was no property. 
A friend or two as good as own the farm, 
Such as it is. It isn't worth the mortgage/ 

'I mean Estelle has always held the purse/ 

'The rights of that are harder to get at. 
I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse. 
'Twas we let him have money, not he us. 
John's a bad farmer. I'm not blaming him. 
Take it year in, year out, he doesn't make much. 
We came here for a home for me, you know, 
Estelle to do the housework for the board 
Of both of us. But look how it turns out: 
She seems to have the housework, and besides 
Half of the outdoor work, though as for that, 
He'd say she does it more because she likes it. 

101 



You see our pretty things are all outdoors. 

Our hens and cows and pigs are always better 

Than folks like us have any business with. 

Farmers around twice as well off as we 

Haven't as good. They don't go with the farm. 

One thing you can't help liking about John, 

He's fond of nice things too fond, some would say. 

But Estelle don't complain: she's like him there. 

She wants our hens to be the best there are. 

You never saw this room before a show, 

Full of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds 

In separate coops, having their plumage done. 

The smell of the wet feathers in the heat! 

You spoke of John's not being safe to stay with. 

You don't know what a gentle lot we are: 

We wouldn't hurt a hen! You ought to see us 

Moving a flock of hens from place to place. 

We're not allowed to take them upside down, 

All we can hold together by the legs. 

Two at a time's the rule, one on each arm, 

No matter how far and how many times 

We have to go/ 

' You mean that's John's idea/ 

'And we live up to it; or I don't know 
What childishness he wouldn't give way to. 
He manages to keep the upper hand 
On his own farm. He's boss. But as to hens: 
We fence our flowers in and the hens range. 

102 



Nothing's too good for them. We say it pays. 
John likes to tell the offers he has had, 
Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that. 
He never takes the money. If they're worth 
That much to sell, they ' re worth as much to keep. 
Bless you, it's all expense, though. Reach me down 
The little tin box on the cupboard shelf, 
The upper shelf, the tin box. That's the one. 
Til show you. Here you are/ 

'What's this?' 

'Abill- 

For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock 
Receipted. And the cock is in the yard/ 

'Not in a glass case, then?' 

'He'd need a tall one: 
He can eat off a barrel from the ground. 
He's been in a glass case, as you may say, 
The Crystal Palace, London. He's imported. 
John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads-* 
Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don't complain. 
But you see, don't you, we take care of him.' 

'And like it, too. It makes it all the worse/ 

'It seems as if. And that's not all: he's helpless 
In ways that I can hardly tell you of. 

103 



Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts 
To see where all the money goes so fast. 
You know how men will be ridiculous. 
But it's just fun the way he gets bedeviled 
If he's untidy now, what will he be?' 

J It makes it all the worse. You must be blind/ 
'Estelle's the one. You needn't talk to me/ 

J Can't you and I get to the root of it? 

What's the real trouble? What will satisfy her?' 

"It's as I say; she's turned from him, that's ali/ 

'But why, when she's well off? Is it the neighbours, 
Being cut off from friends?' 

< We have our friends. 
That isn't it. Folks aren't afraid of us/ 

'She's let it worry her. You stood the strain, 
And you're her mother/ 

'But I didn't always. 
I didn't relish it along at first. 
But I got wonted to it. And besides 
John said I was too old to have grandchildren. 
But what's the use of talking when it's done? 
She won't come back it's worse than that she can't. 1 

104 



< Why do you speak like that? What do you know? 
What do you mean? she's done harm to herself?' 

'I mean she's marriedmarried someone else/ 
'Oho, oho!' 

'You don't believe me/ 

'Yes, I do, 

Only too well. I knew there must be something! 
So that was what was back. She's bad, that's all!' 

'Bad to get married when she had the chance?' 
'Nonsense! See what she's done! But who, but who 

'Who'd marry her straight out of such a mess? 
Say it right out no matter for her mother. 
The man was found. I'd better name no names. 
John himself won't imagine who he is/ 

'Then it's all up. I think I'll get away. 
You'll be expecting John. I pity Estelle; 
I suppose she deserves some pity, too. 
You ought to have the kitchen to yourself 
To break it to him. You may have the job/ 

'You needn't think you're going to get away, 
John's almost here. I've had my eye on someone 

105 



Coming down Ryan's Hill. I thought 'twas him. 
Here he is now. This box! Put it away. 
And this bill/ 

What's the hurry? He'll unhitch/ 

'No, he won't, either. He'll just drop the reins 
And turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all. 
She won't get far before the wheels hang up 
On something there's no harm. See, there he is! 
My, but he looks as if he must have heard!' 

John threw the door wide but he didn't enter. 
'How are you, neighbour? Just the man I'm after. 
Isn't it Hell,' he said. 'I want to know. 
Come out here if you want to hear me talk. 
Til talk to you, old woman, afterward. 
I've got some news that maybe isn't news. 
What are they trying to do to me, these two? 7 

'Do go along with him and stop his shouting/ 
She raised her voice against the closing door: 
"Who wants to hear your news, youdreadful fool?' 



106 



THE FEAR 

A lantern light from deeper in the barn 
Shone on a man and woman in the door 
And threw their lurching shadows on a house 
Near by, all dark in every glossy window. 
A horse's hoof pawed once the hollow floor, 
And the back of the gig they stood beside 
Moved in a little. The man grasped a wheel, 
The woman spoke out sharply, 'Whoa, stand still! 
I saw it just as plain as a white plate/ 
She said, 'as the light on the dashboard ran 
Along the bushes at the roadside a man's face. 
You must have seen it too/ 

1 didn't see it. 
Are you sure' 

' Yes, I'm sure!' 

'it was a face?' 

*}oel, Til have to look. I can't go in, 
I can't, and leave a thing like that unsettled. 
Doors locked and curtains drawn will make no dif- 
ference. 

I always have felt strange when we came home 
To the dark house after so long an absence, 
And the key rattled loudly into place 

107 



Seemed to warn someone to be getting out 
At one door as we entered at another. 
What if Fm right, and someone all the time- 
Don' t hold my arm!' 

1 say it's someone passing/ 

'You speak as if this were a travelled road. 
You forget where we are. What is beyond 
That he'd be going to or coming from 
At such an hour of night, and on foot too? 
What was he standing still for in the bushes?' 

It's not so very late -it's only dark. 

There's more in it than you're inclined to say. 

Did he look like-?' 

'He looked like anyone. 
I'll never rest to-night unless I know. 
Give me the lantern.' 

'You don't want the lantern. 
She pushed past him and got it for herself. 

'You're not to come/ she said. 'This is my business 
If the time's come to face it, Fm the one 
To put it the right way. He'd never dare 
Listen! He kicked a stone. Hear that, hear that! 
He's coming towards us. Joel, go in please. 
Hark! 1 don't hear him now. But please go in/ 

108 



'In the first place you can't make me believe 

it's-' 

'It is or someone else he's sent to watch. 
And now's the time to have it out with him 
While we know definitely where he is. 
Let him get off and he'll be everywhere 
Around us, looking out of trees and bushes 
Till I sha'n't dare to set a foot outdoors. 
And I can't stand it. Joel, let me go!' 

'But it's nonsense to think he'd care enough.' 

( You mean you couldn't understand his caring. 
Oh, but you see he hadn't had enough- 
Joel; I won't I won' t I promise you. 
We mustn't say hard things. You mustn't either.' 

Til be the one, if anybody goes! 

But you give him the advantage with this light. 

What couldn't he do to us standing here! 

And if to see was what he wanted, why 

He has seen all there was to see and gone/ 

He appeared to forget to* keep his hold, 

But advanced with her as she crossed the grass. 

4 What do you want?' she cried to all the dark. 
She stretched up tall to overlook the light 
That hung in both hands hot against her skirt. 



'There's no one; so you're wrong/ he said. 

'There ib. 

What do you want?' she cried, and then herself 
Was startled when an answer really came. 

'Nothing/ It came from well along the road. 

She reached a hand to Joel for support: 

The smell of scorching woollen made her faint. 

"What are you doing round this house at night?' 
'Nothing.' A pause: there seemed no more to say. 

And then the voice again: You seem afraid. 
I saw by the way you whipped up the horse. 
I'll just come forward in the lantern light 
And let you see.' 

'Yes, do. Joel, go back!' 

She stood her ground against the noisy steps 
That came on, but her body rocked a little. 

'You see/ the voice said. 

'Oh.' She looked and looked. 



110 



1 You don't secI've a child here by the hand. 
A robber wouldn't have his family with him/ 

* What's a child doing at this time of night?' 

'Out walking. Every child should have the memory 
Of at least one long-after-bedtime walk. 
What, son?' 

'Then I should think you'd try to find 
Somewhere to walk' 

'The highway, as it happens- 
We're stopping for the fortnight down at Dean's.' 

'But if that's all Joelyou realize 

You won't think anything. You understand? 

You understand that we have to be careful. 

This is a very, very lonely place. 

Joel!' She spoke as if she couldn't turn. 

The swinging lantern lengthened to the ground, 

It touched, it struck, it clattered and went out. 



Ill 



THE WOOD-PILE 

Out walking in the frozen swamp one grey day, 

I paused and said, 'I will turn back from here. 

No, I will go on farther and we shall see/ 

The hard snow held me, save where now and then 

One foot went through. The view was all in lines 

Straight up and down of tall slim trees 

Too much alike to mark or name a place by 

So as to say for certain I was here 

Or somewhere else: I was just far from home. 

A small bird flew before me. He was careful 

To put a tree between us when tye lighted, 

And say no word to tell me who he was 

Who was so foolish as to think what he thought. 

He thought that I was after him for a feather 

The white one in his tail; like one who takes 

Everything said as personal to himself. 

One flight out sideways would have undeceived him. 

And then there was a pile of wood for which 

I forgot him and let his little fear 

Carry him off the way I might have gone, 

Without so much as wishing him good-night. 

He went behind it to make his last stand. 

It was a cord of maple, cut and split 

And piled and measured, four by four by eight. 

And not another like it could I see. 

No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it. 

And it was older sure than this year's cutting, 

112 



Or even last year's or the year's before. 

The wood was grey and the bark warping off it 

And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis 

Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle, 

What held it though on one side was a tree 

Still growing, and on one a stake and prop, 

These latter about to fall. I thought that only 

Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks 

Could so forget his handiwork on which 

He spent himself, the labour of his axe, 

And leave it there far from a useful fireplace 

To warm the frozen swamp as best it could 

With the slow smokeless burning of decay. 



GOOD HOURS 

I had for my winter evening walk 
No one at all with whom to talk, 
But I had the cottages in a row 
Up to their shining eyes in snow. 

And I thought I had the folk within: 
I had the sound of a violin; 
I had a glimpse through curtain laces 
Of youthful forms and youthful faces 

I had such company outward bound. 
I went till there were no cottages found. 
I turned and repented, but coming back 
I saw no window but that was black. 

Over the snow my creaking feet 
Disturbed the slumbering village street 
Like profanation, by your leave. 
At ten o'clock of a winter eve. 



114 



Mountain Interval 



THE ROAD NOT TAKEN 

1 wo roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
And sorry I could not travel both 
And be one traveler, long I stood 
And looked down one as far as I could 
To where it bent in the undergrowth; 

Then took the other, as just as fair, 
And having perhaps the better claim, 
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; 
Though as for that the passing there 
Had worn them really about the same, 

And both that morning equally lay 
In leaves no step had trodden black. 
Oh, I kept the first for another day! 
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, 
I doubted if I should ever come back. 

I shall be telling this with a sigh 
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference. 



CHRISTMAS TREES 

A CHRISTMAS CIRCULAR LETTER 

The city had withdrawn into itself 

And left at last the country to the country; 

When between whirls of snow not come to lie 

And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove 

A stranger to our yard, who looked the city, 

Yet did in country fashion in that there 

He sat and waited till he drew us out 

A-buttoning coats to ask him who he was. 

He proved to be the city come again 

To look for something it had left behind 

And could not do without and keep its Christmas. 

He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees; 

My woods the young fir balsams like a place 

Where houses all are churches and have spires. 

I hadn't thought of them as Christmas trees. 

I doubt if I was tempted for a moment 

To sell them off their feet to go in cars 

And leave the slope behind the house all bare, 

Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon. 

I'd hate to have them know it if I was. 

Yet more I'd hate to hold my trees except 

As others hold theirs or refuse for them, 

Beyond the time of profitable growth, 

The trial by market everything must come to. 

I dallied so much with the thought of selling. 

Then whether from mistaken courtesy 

118 



And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether 
From hope of hearing good of what was mine, 
I said, 'There aren't enough to be worth while/ 

'I could soon tell how many they would cut, 
You let me look them over/ 

'You could look. 

But don't expect I'm going to let you have them/ 
Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close 
That lop each other of boughs, but not a few 
Quite solitary and having equal boughs 
All round and round. The latter he nodded 'Yes' to, 
Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one, 
With a buyer's moderation, 'That would do/ 
I thought so too, but wasn't there to say so. 
We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over, 
And came down on the north. 

He said, 'A thousand/ 
'A thousand Christmas trees! at what apiece? J 

He felt some need of softening that to me: 

' A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars/ 

Then I was certain I had never meant 

To let him have them. Never show surprise! 

But thirty dollars seemed so small beside 

The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents 

119 



(For that was all they figured out apiece), 
Three cents so small beside the dollar friends 
I should be writing to within the hour 
Would pay in cities for good trees like those, 
Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools 
Could hang enough on to pick off enough. 
A thousand Christmas trees I didn't know I had! 
Worth three cents more to give away than sell 
As may be shown by a simple calculation. 
Too bad I couldn't lay one in a letter. 
I can't help wishing I could send you one, 
In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.

AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT 

All out of doors looked darkly in at him 
Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars. 
That gathers on the pane in empty rooms. 
What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze 
Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand. 
What kept him from remembering the need 
That brought him to that creaking room was age. 
He stood with barrels round him at a loss. 
And having scared the cellar under him 
In clomping there, he scared it once again 
In clomping off;- and scared the outer night, 
Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar 
Of trees and crack of branches, common things, 
But nothing so like beating on a box. 
A light he was to no one but himself 

aiHaO ' 

Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what, 

A quiet light, and then not even that. 

He consigned to the moon, such as she was, 

So late-arising, to the broken moon 

As better than the sun in any case 

For such a charge, his snow upon the roof, 

His icicles along the wall to keep; 

And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt 

Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted, 

And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept. 

One aged manone mancan't keep a house, 

12! 



A farm, a countryside, or if he can, 
It's thus he does it of a winter night. 



122 



THE TELEPHONE 

\Vhen I was just as far as I could walk 
From here to-day, 
There was an hour 
All still 

When leaning with my head against a flower 
I heard you talk. 

Don't say I didn't, for I heard you say 
You spoke from that flower on the window sill- 
Do you remember what it was you said?' 

'First tell me what it was you thought you heard.' 

' Having found the flower and driven a bee away, 

I leaned my head, 

And holding by the stalk, 

I listened and I thought I caught the word 

What was it? Did you call me by my name? 

Or did you say 

Someone said "Com^" I heard it as I bowed/ 

'I may have thought as much, but not aloudo ' 
' Well, so I came" 



123 



HYLA BROOK 

JDy June our brook's run out of song and speed. 

Sought for much after that, it will be found 

Either to have gone groping underground 

(And taken with it all the Hyla breed 

That shouted in the mist a month ago, 

Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow) - 

Or flourished and come up in jewel-weed, 

Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent 

Even against the way its waters went. 

Its bed is left a faded paper sheet 

Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat 

A brook to none but who remember long. 

This as it will be seen is other far 

Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song. 

We love the things we love for what they are. 



124 



THE OVEN BIRD 

1 here is a singer everyone has heard, 
Loud, a mid-summer and a mid- wood bird, 
Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again. 
He says that leaves are old and that for flowers 
Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten. 
Ke says the early petal-fall is past 
When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers 
On sunny days a moment overcast; 
And comes that other fall we name the fall. 
He says the highway dust is over all. 
The bird would cease and be as other birds 
But that he knows in singing not to sing. 
The question that he frames in all but words 
Is what to make of a diminished thing. 



BOND AND FREE 

.Love has earth to which she clings 
With hills and cii cling arms about- 
Wall within wall to shut fear out. 
But Thought has need of no such things, 
For Thought has a pair of dauntless wings. 

On snow and sand and turf, I see 
Where Love has left a printed trace 
With straining in the world's embrace. 
And such is Love and glad to be. 
But Thought has shaken his ankles free. 

Thought cleaves the interstellar gloom 
And sits in Sirius' disc all night, 
Till day makes him retrace his flight, 
With smell of burning on every plume, 
Back past the sun to an earthly room. 

His gains in heaven are what they are. 
Yet some say Love by being thrall 
And simply staying possesses all 
In several beauty that Thought fares far 
To find fused in another star. 



126 



Small good to anything growing wild, 
They were crooking many a trillium 

That had budded before the boughs v/ere piled 
And since it was coming up had to come. 



131 



PUTTING IN THE SEED 

You come to fetch me from my work to-night 

When supper's on the table, and we'll see 

If I can leave off burying the white 

Soft petals fallen from the apple tree 

(Soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite, 

Mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea;) 

And go along with you ere you lose sight 

Of what you came for and become like me, 

Slave to a springtime passion for the earth. 

How Love burns through the Putting in the Seed 

On through the watching for that early birth 

When, just as the soil tarnishes with weed, 

The sturdy seedling with arched body comes 
Shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs. 



A TIME TO TALK 

\Vhen a friend calls to me from the road 

And slows his horse to a meaning walk, 

I don't stand still and look around 

On all the hills I haven't hoed, 

And shout from where I am, 'What is it?' 

No, not as there is a time to talk. 

1 thrust my hoe in the mellow ground., 

Blade-end up and five feet tall, 

And plod. I go up to the stone wall 

For a friendly visit. 



133 



THE COW IN APPLE TIME 

oomething inspires the only cow of late 

To make no more of a wall than an open gate, 

And think no more of wall-builders than fools. 

Her face is flecked with pomace and she drools 

A cider syrup. Having tasted fruit, 

She scorns a pasture withering to the root. 

She runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten 

The windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten. 

She leaves them bitten when she has to fly. 

She bellows on a knoll against the sky. 

Her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry. 



134 



AN ENCOUNTER 

Once on the kind of day called < weather breeder/ 

When the heat slowly hazes and the sun 

By its own power seems to be undone, 

I was half boring through, half climbing through 

A swamp of cedar. Choked with oil of cedar 

And scurf of plants, and weary and over-heated, 

And sorry I ever left the road I knew, 

I paused and rested on a sort of hook 

That had me by the coat as good as seated, 

And since there was no other way to look, 

Looked up toward heaven, and there against the blue, 

Stood over me a resurrected tree, 

A tree that had been down and raised again 

A barkless spectre. He had halted too, 

As if for fear of treading upon me. 

I saw the strange position of his hands 

Up at his shoulders, dragging yellow strands 

Of wire with something in it from men to men. 

4 You here?' I said. 'Where aren't you nowadays? 

And what's the news you carry if you know? 

And tell me where you're off tor Montreal? 

Me? I'm not off for anywhere at all. 

Sometimes I wander out of beaten ways 

Half looking for the orchid Calypso/ 



135 



RANGE-FINDING 

The battle rent a cobweb diamond-strung 

And cut a flower beside a ground bird's nest 

Before it stained a single human breast. 

The stricken flower bent double and so hung. 

And still the bird revisited her young. 

A butterfly its fall had dispossessed 

A moment sought in air his flower of rest, 

Then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung. 

On the bare upland pasture there had spread 
Overnight 'twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread 
And straining cables wet with silver dew. 
A sudden passing bullet shook it dry. 
The indwelling spider ran to greet the fly, 
But finding nothing, sullenly withdrew. 



136 



THE HILL WIFE 

LONELINESS 
Her Word 

One ought not to have to care 

So much as you and I 
Care when the birds come round the house 

To seem to say good-bye; 

Or care so much when they come back 
With whatever it is they sing; 

The truth being we are as much 
Too glad for the one thing 

As we are too sad for the other here 
With birds that fill their breasts 

But with each other and themselves 
And their built or driven nests. 

HOUSE FEAR 

Always I tell you this they learned 
Always at night when they returned 
To the lonely house from far away 
To lamps unlighted and fire gone gray, 
They learned to rattle the lock and key 
To give whatever might chance to be 
Warning and time to be off in flight: 



And preferring the out- to the in-door night, 
They learned to leave the house-door wide 
Until they had lit the lamp inside. 

THE SMILE 
Her Word 

I didn't like the way he went away. 

That smile! It never came of being gay. 

Still he smileddid you see him? I was sure! 

Perhaps because we gave htm only bread 

And the wretch knew from that that we were poor 

Perhaps because he let us give instead 

Of seizing from us as he might have seized. 

Perhaps he mocked at us for being wed, 

Or being very young (and he was pleased 

To have a vision of us old and dead). 

I wonder how far down the road he's got. 

He's watching from the woods as like as not. 

THE OFT-REPEATED DREAM 

She had no saying dark enough 

For the dark pine that kept 
Forever trying the window-latch 

Of the room where they slept. 

The tireless but ineffectual hands 
That with every futile pass 



Made the great tree seem as a little bird 
Before the mystery of glass! 

It never had been inside the room, 

And only one of the two 
Was afraid in an oft-repeated dream 

Of what the tree might do. 



THE IMPULSE 

It was too lonely for her there, 

And too wild, 
And since there were but two of them, 

And no child, 

And work was little in the house. 

She was free, 
And followed where he furrowed field, 

Or felled tree. 

She rested on a log and tossed 

The fresh chips, 
With a song only to herself 

On her lips. 

And once she went to break a bough 

Of black alder. 
She strayed so far she scarcely heard 

When he called her 



139 



And didn't answer didn't speak 

Or return. 
She stood, and then she ran and hid 

In the fern. 

He never found her, though he looked 

Everywhere, 
And he asked at her mother's house 

V/as she there. 

Sudden and swift and light as that 

The ties gave, 
And he learned of finalities 

Besides the grave. 



140 



THE BONFIRE 



, let's go up the hill and scare ourselves, 
As reckless as the best of them to-night, 
By setting fire to all the brush we piled 
With pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow. 
Oh, let's not wait for rain to make it safe. 
The pile is ours: we dragged it bough on bough 
Down dark converging paths between the pines. 
Let's not care what we do with it to-night. 
Divide it? No! But burn it as one pile 
The way we piled it. And let's be the talk 
Of people brought to windows by a light 
Thrown from somewhere against their wall-paper. 
Rouse them all, both the free and not so free 
With saying what they'd like to do to us 
For what they'd better wait till we have done. 
Let's all but bring to life this old volcano, 
If that is what the mountain ever was 
And scare ourselves. Let wild fire loose we will . . 

'And scare you too?' the children said together. 

* Why wouldn't it scare me to have a fire 

Begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know 

That still, if I repent, I may recall it, 

But in a moment not: a little spurt 

Of burning fatness, and then nothing but 

The fire itself can put it out, and that 

141 



By burning out, and before it burns out 
It will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars > 
And sweeping round it with a flaming sword, 
Made the dim trees stand back in wider circle- 
Done so much and I know not how much more 
I mean it shall not do if I can bind it. 
Well if it doesn't with its draft bring on 
A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter, 
As once it did with me upon an April. 
The breezes were so spent with winter blowing 
They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them 
Short of the perch their languid flight was toward, 
And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven 
As I walked once around it in possession. 
But the wind out of doorsyou know the saying. 
There came a gust. You used to think the trees 
Made wind by fanning since you never knew 
It blow but that you saw the trees in motion. 
Something or someone watching made that gust. 
It put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass 
Of over- winter with the least tip-touch 
Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand. 
The place it reached to blackened instantly. 
The black was almost all there was by day-light, 
That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke 
And a flame slender as the hepaticas, 
Blood-root, and violets so soon to be now. 
But the black spread like black death on the ground, 
And I think the sky darkened with a cloud 
Like winter and evening coming on together. 

142 



They were enough things to be thought of then. 
Where the field stretches toward the north 
And setting sun to Hyla brook, I gave it 
To flames without twice thinking, where it verges 
Upon the road, to flames too, though in fear 
They might find fuel there, in withered brake, 
Grass its full length, old silver golden-rod, 
And alder and grape vine entanglement, 
To leap the dusty deadline. For my own 
I took what front there was beside. I knelt 
And thrust hands in and held my face away. 
Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating. 
A board is the best weapon if you have it. 
I had my coat. And oh, I knew, I knew, 
And said out loud, I couldn't bide the smother 
And heat so close in; but the thought of all 
The woods and town on fire by me, and all 
The town turned out to fight for me that held me. 
I trusted the brook barrier, but feared 
The road would fail; and on that side the fire 
Died not without a noise of crackling wood 
Of something more than tinder-grass and weed- 
That brought me to my feet to hold it back 
By leaning back myself, as if the reins 
Were round my neck and I was at the plough, 
I won! But I'm sure no one ever spread 
Another color over a tenth the space 
That I spread coal-black over in the time 
It took me. Neighbors coming home from town 
Couldn't believe that so much black had come there 

143 



While they had backs turned, that it hadn't been there 
When they had passed an hour or so before 
Going the other way and they not seen it. 
They looked about for someone to have done it. 
But there was no one. I was somewhere wondering 
Where all my weariness had gone and why 
I walked so light on air in heavy shoes 
In spite of a scorched Fourth-of-July feeling. 
Why wouldn't I be scared remembering that?' 

'If it scares you, what will it do to us?' 

'Scare you. But if you shrink from being scared, 
What would you say to war if it should come? 
That's what for reasons I should like to know 
If you can comfort me by any answer.' 

'Oh, but war's not for childrenit's for men.' 

'Now we are digging almost down to China. 

My dears, my dears, you thought that we all thought 

it. 

So your mistake was ours. Haven't you heard, though, 
About the ships where war has found them out 
At sea, about the towns where war has come 
Through opening clouds at night with droning speed 
Further o'erhead than all but stars and angels, 
And children in the ships and in the towns? 
Haven't you heard what we have lived to learn? 
Nothing so new something we had forgotten: 

144 



War is for everyone, for children too. 
I wasn't going to tell you and I mustn't. 
The best way is to come up hill with me 
And have our fire and laugh and be afraid/ 



145 



THE LAST WORD OF A BLUEBIRD 
AS TOLD TO A CHILD 

As I went out a Crow 

In a low voice said 'Oh ; 

I was looking for you. 

How do you do? 

I just came to tell you 

To tell Lesley (will you?) 

That her little Bluebird 

Wanted me to bring word 

That the north wind last night 

That made the stars bright 

And made ice on the trough 

Almost made him cough 

His tail feathers off. 

He just had to fly! 

But he sent her Good-bye, 

And said to be good, 

And wear her red hood, 

And look for skunk tracks 

In the snow with an axe 

And do everything! 

And perhaps in the spring 

He would come back and sing.' 



146 



'OUT, 



1 he buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard 
And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of 

wood, 

Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it. 
And from there those that lifted eyes could count 
Five mountain ranges one behind the other 
Under the sunset far into Vermont. 
And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled, 
As it ran light, or had to bear a load. 
And nothing happened: day was all but done. 
Call it a day, I wish they might have said 
To please the boy by giving him the half hour 
That a boy counts so much when saved from work. 
His sister stood beside them in her apron 
To tell them 'Supper.' At the word, the saw, 
As if to prove saws knew what supper meant, 
Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap- 
He must have given the hand. However it was, 
Neither refused the meeting. But the hand! 
^ ne boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh, 
As he swung toward them holding up the hand 
Half in appeal, but half as if to keep 
The life from spilling. Then the boy saw ail- 
Since he was old enough to know, big boy 
Doing a man's work, though a child at heart- 
He saw all spoiled. 'Don't let him cut my hand off 
The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister P 

147 



So. But the hand was gone already. 

The doctor put him in the dark of ether. 

He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath. 

And then the watcher at his pulse took fright. 

No one believed. They listened at his heart. 

Littleless nothing! and that ended it. 

No more to build on there. And they, since they 

Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.

BROWN'S DESCENT 

OR 

THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE 

Drown lived at such a lofty farm 
That everyone for miles could see 

His lantern when he did his chores 
In winter after half-past three. 

And many must have seen him make 
His wild descent from there one night, 

'Cross lots, 'cross walls, 'cross everything, 
Describing rings of lantern light. 

Between the house and barn the gale 
Got him by something he had on 

And blew him out on the icy crust 

That cased the world, and he was gone! 

Walls were all buried, trees were few: 

He saw no stay unless he stove 
A hole in somewhere with his heel. 

But though repeatedly he strove 

And stamped and said things to himself, 
And sometimes something seemed to yield, 

He gained no foothold, but pursued 
His journey down from field to field. 



149 



Sometimes he came with arms outspread 
Like wings, revolving in the scene 

Upon his longer axis, and 

With no small dignity of mien. 

Faster or slower as he chanced, 

Sitting or standing as he chose, 
According as he feared to risk 

His neck, or thought to spare his clothes, 

He never let the lantern drop. 

And some exclaimed who saw afar 
The figures he described with it, 

( I wonder what those signals are 

Brown makes at such an hour of night! 

He's celebrating something strange. 
I wonder if he's sold his farm, 

Or been made Master of the Grange/ 

He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked; 

He fell and made the lantern rattle 
(But saved the light from going out.) 

So half-way down he fought the battle, 

Incredulous of his own bad luck. 

And then becoming reconciled 
To everything, he gave it up 

And came down like a coasting child. 

150 



' Well-I-be-' that was all he said, 
As standing in the river road, 

He looked back up the slippery slope 
(Two miles it was) to his abode. 

Sometimes as an authority 
On motor-cars, Fm asked if I 

Should say our stock was petered out, 
And this is my sincere reply: 

Yankees are what they always were. 

Don't think Brown ever gave up hope 
Of getting home again because 

He couldn't climb that slippery slope; 

Or even thought of standing there 

Until the January thaw 
Should take the polish off the crust. 

He bowed with grace to natural law, 

And then went round it on his feet, 
After the manner of our stock; 

Not much concerned for those to whom, 
At that particular time o'clock, 

It must have looked as if the course 
He steered was really straight away 

From that which he was headed for 
Not much concerned for them, I say; 



151 



No more so than became a man 
And politician at odd seasons. 

I've kept Brown standing in the cold 
While I invested him with reasons; 

But now he snapped his eyes three times; 

Then shook his lantern, saying, He's 
'Bout out!' and took the long way home 

By road, a matter of several miles. 



152 



THE GUM-GATHERER 

There overtook me and drew me in 

To his down-hill, early-morning stride, 

And set me five miles on my road 

Better than if he had had me ride, 

A man with a swinging bag for load 

And half the bag wound round his hand. 

We talked like barking above the din 

Of water we walked along beside. 

And for my telling him where I'd been 

And where I lived in mountain land 

To be coming home the way I was, 

He told me a little about himself. 

He came from higher up in the pass 

Where the grist of the new-beginning brooks 

Is blocks split off the mountain mass 

And hopeless grist enough it looks 

Ever to grind to soil for grass. 

(The way it is will do for moss.) 

There he had built his stolen shack. 

It had to be a stolen shack 

Because of the fears of fire and loss 

That trouble the sleep of lumber folk: 

Visions of half the world burned black 

And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke. 

We know who when they come to town 

Bring berries under the wagon seat, 

Or a basket of eggs between their feet; 



153 



What this man brought in a cotton sack 
Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce. 
He showed me lumps of the scented stuff 
Like uncut jewels, dull and rough. 
It conies to market golden brown; 
But turns to pink between the teeth. 

I told him this is a pleasant life 
To set your breast to the bark of trees 
That all your days are dim beneath, 
And reaching up with a little knife, 
To loose the resin and take it down 
And bring it to market when you please. 



154 



THE LINE-GANG 

Jriere come the line-gang pioneering by. 
They throw a forest down less cut than broken. 
They plant dead trees for living, and the dead 
They string together with a living thread. 
They string an instrument against the sky 
Wherein words whether beaten out or spoken 
Will run as hushed as when they were a thought. 
But in no hush they string it: they go past 
With shouts afar to pull the cable taut, 
To hold it hard until they make it fast, 
To ease away they have it. With a laugh, 
An oath of towns that set the wild at naught 
They bring the telephone and telegraph. 



155 



THE VANISHING RED 

lie is said to have been the last Red Man 

In Acton. And the Miller is said to have laughed 

If you like to call such a sound a laugh. 

But he gave no one else a laughter's license. 

For he turned suddenly grave as if to say, 

' Whose business,if I take it on myself, 

Whose businessbut why talk round the barn? 

When it's just that I hold with getting a thing done 

with. 

You can't get back and see it as he saw it. 
It's too long a story to go into now. 
You'd have to have been there and lived it. 
Then you wouldn't have looked on it as just a matter 
Of who began it between the two races. 

Some guttural exclamation of surprise 
The Red Man gave in poking about the mill 
Over the great big thumping shuffling mill-stone 
Disgusted the Miller physically as coming 
From one who had no right to be heard from. 
'Come, John/ he said, 'you want to see the wheel pit? > 

He took him down below a cramping rafter, 
And showed him, through a manhole in the floor, 
The water in desperate straits like frantic fish, 
Salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails. 
Then he shut down the trap door with a ring in it 

156 



That jangled even above the general noise, 
And came up stairs alone and gave that laugh, 
And said something to a man with a meal-sack 
That the man with the meal-sack didn't catch then. 
Oh, yes, he showed John the wheel pit all right. 



157 



SNOW 

1 he three stood listening to a fresh access 
Of wind that caught against the house a moment, 
Gulped snow, and then blew free again the Coles 
Dressed, but dishevelled from some hours of sleep, 
Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore. 

Meserve was first to speak. He pointed backward 
Over his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying, 
* You can just see it glancing off the roof 
Making a great scroll upward toward the sky, 
Long enough for recording all our names on. 
I think Til just call up my wife and tell her 
I'm here so far and starting on again. 
I'll call her softly so that if she's wise 
And gone to sleep, she needn't wake to answer/ 
Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened. 
'Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I'm at Cole's. I'm late. 
I called you up to say Good-night from here 
Before I went to say Good-morning there. 
I thought I would. I know, but, Lett I know 
I could, but what's the sense? The rest won't be 
So bad. Give me an hour for it. Ho, ho, 
Three hours to here! But that was all up hill; 
The rest is down. Why no, no, not a wallow: 
They kept their heads and took their time to it 
Like darlings, both of them. They're in the barn. 



158 



My dear, I'm coming just the same. I didn't 
Call you to ask you to invite me home. ' 
He lingered for some word she wouldn't say, 
Said it at last himself, * Good-night/ and then 
Getting no answer, closed the telephone. 
The three stood in the lamplight round the table 
With lowered eyes a moment till he said, 
Til just see how the horses are/ 

1 Yes, do/ 

Both the Coles said together. Mrs. Cole 
Added: ' You can judge better after seeing. 
I want you here with me, Fred. Leave him here, 
Brother Meserve. You know to find your way 
Out through the shed/ 

'I guess I know my way, 
I guess I know where I can find my name 
Carved in the shed to tell me who I am 
If it don't tell me where I am. I used 
To play' 

* You tend your horses and come back. 
Fred Cole, you're going to let him!' 

'Well, aren't you: 
How can you help yourself?' 

'I called him Brother. 
Why did I call him that?' 



159 



'It's right enough. 

That's all you ever heard him called round here. 
He seems to have lost off his Christian name/ 

'Christian enough I should call that myself. 

He took no notice, did he? Well, at least 

I didn't use it out of love of him, 

The dear knows. I detest the thought of him 

With his ten children under ten years old. 

I hate his wretched little Racker Sect, 

All's ever I heard of it, which isn't much. 

But that's not saying Look, Fred Cole, it's twelve, 

Isn't it, now? He's been here half an hour. 

He says he left the village store at nine. 

Three hours to do four miles a mile an hour 

Or not much better. Why, it doesn't seem 

As if a man could move that slow and move. 

Try to think what he did with all that time. 

And three miles more to go!' 

'Don't let him go. 

Stick to him, Helen. Make him answer you. 
That sort of man talks straight on all his life 
From the last thing he said himself, stone deaf 
To anything anyone else may say. 
I should have thought, though, you could make him 
hear you/ 

'What is he doing out a night like this? 
Why can't he stay at home?' 

16O 



'He had to preach/ 
'It's no night to be out.' 

'He may be small, 
He may be good, but one thing's sure, he's tough. 1 

'And strong of stale tobacco/ 

'He'll pull through.' 

'You only say so. Not another house 
Or shelter to put into from this place 
To theirs. I'm going to call his wife again.' 

' Wait and he may. Let's see what he will do. 
Let's see if he will think of her again. 
But then I doubt he's thinking of himself. 
He doesn't look on it as anything.' 

'He shan't go there!' 

'It is a night, my dear.' 
'One thing: he didn't drag God into it.' 
'He don't consider it a case for God.' 

'You think so, do you? You don't know the kind. 
He's getting up a miracle this minute. 

161 



Privatelyto himself, right now, he's thinking 
He*!! make a case of it if he succeeds, 
But keep still if he fails/ 

'Keep still all over. 
He'll be dead dead and buried/ 

'Such a trouble! 

Not but I've every reason not to care 
What happens to him if it only takes 
Some of the sanctimonious conceit 
Out of one of those pious scalawags/ 

'Nonsense to that! You want to see him safe/ 
"You like the runt/ 

'Don't you a little?' 

'Well, 

I don't like what he's doing, which is what 
You like, and like him for/ 

'Oh, yes you do. 

You like your fun as well as anyone; 
Only you women have to put these airs on 
To impress men. You've got us so ashamed 
Of being men we can't look at a good fight 
Between two boys and not feel bound to stop it. 
Let the man freeze an ear or two, I say. 

162 



He's here. I leave him all to you. Go in 

And save his life. All right, come in, Meserve. 

Sit down, sit down. How did you find the horses? 1 

Tine, fine/ 

t And ready for some more? My wife her 
Says it wont do. You've got to give it up/ 

'Won't you to please me? Please! If I say please? 
Mr. Meserve, I'll leave it to your wife. 
What did your wife say on the telephone?' 

Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp 
Or something not far from it on the table. 
By straightening out and lifting a forefinger, 
He pointed with his hand from where it lay 
Like a white crumpled spider on his knee: 
'That leaf there in your open book! It moved 
Just then, I thought. It's stood erect like that, 
There on the table, ever since I came, 
Trying to turn itself backward or forward, 
I've had my eye on it to make out which; 
If forward, then it's with a friend's impatience 
You see I know to get you on to things 
It wants to see how you will take, if backward 
It's from regret for something you have passed 
And failed to see the good of. Never mind, 
Things must expect to come in front of us 
A many times I don't say just how many 

163 



That varies with the things before we see them. 

One of the lies would makfe it out that nothing 

Ever presents itself before us twice. 

Where would we be at last if that were so? 

Our very life depends on everything's 

Recurring till we answer from within. 

The thousandth time may prove the charm. That 

leaf! 

It can't turn either way. It needs the wind's help. 
But the wind didn't move it if it moved. 
It moved itself. The wind's at naught in here. 
It couldn't stir so sensitively poised 
A thing as that. It couldn't reach the lamp 
To get a puff of black smoke from the flame, 
Or blow a rumple in the collie's coat. 
You make a little foursquare block of air, 
Quiet and light and warm, in spite of all 
The illimitable dark and cold and storm, 
And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog, 
And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose; 
Though for all anyone can tell, repose 
May be the thing you haven't, yet you give it. 
So false it is that what we haven't we can't give; 
So false, that what we always say is true. 
I'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will. 
It won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?' 

1 shouldn't want to hurry you, Meserve, 
But if you're going Say you'll stay, you know* 
But let me raise this curtain on a scene, 

164 



And show you how it's piling up against you. 
You see the snow-white through the white of frost? 
Ask Helen how far up the sash it's climbed 
Since last we read the gage/ 

'It looks as if 

Some pallid thing had squashed its features flat 
And its eyes shut with overeagerness 
To see what people found so interesting 
In one another, and had gone to sleep 
Of its own stupid lack of understanding, 
Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff 
Short off, and died against the window-pane/ 

'Brother Meserve, take care, you'll scare yourself 
More than you will us with such nightmare talk. 
It's you it matters to, because it's you 
Who have to go out into it alone.' 

'Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he'll stay/ 

'Before you drop the curtain I'm reminded: 

You recollect the boy who came out here 

To breathe the air one winter had a room 

Down at the Averys'? Well, one sunny morning 

After a downy storm, he passed our place 

And found me banking up the house with snow. 

And I was burrowing in deep for warmth, 

Piling it well above the window-sills. 

The snow against the window caught his eye. 

165 



"Hey, that's a pretty thought " those were his 

words. 

"So you can think it's six feet deep outside, 
While you sit warm and read up balanced rations. 
You can't get too much winter in the winter." 
Those were his words. And he went home and all 
But banked the daylight out of Avery's windows. 
Now you and I would go to no such length. 
At the same time you can't deny it makes 
It not a mite worse, sitting here, we three, 
Playing our fancy, to have the snowliiie run 
So high across the pane outside. There where 
There is a sort of tunnel in the frost 
More like a tunnel than a hole way down 
At the far end of it you see a stir 
And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift 
Blown in the wind. I like that I like that. 
Well, now I leave you, people.' 

'Come, Meserve, 

We thought you were deciding not to go 
The ways you found to say the praise of comfort 
And being where you are. You want to stay/ 

Til own it's cold for such a fall of snow. 
This house is frozen brittle, all except 
This room you sit in. If you think the wind 
Sounds further off, it's not because it's dying; 
You're further under in the snow that's all 
\nd feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust 

166 



It bursts against us at the chimney mouth, 
And at the eaves. I like it from inside 
More than I shall out in it. But the horses 
Are rested and it's time to say good-night, 
And let you get to bed again. Good-night, 
Sorry I had to break in on your sleep/ 

* Lucky for you you did. Lucky for you 
You had us for a half-way station 
To stop at. If you were the kind of man 
Paid heed to women, you'd take my advice 
And for your family's sake stay where you are. 
But what good is my saying it over and over? 
You've done more than you had a right to think 
You could donoiu. You know the risk you take 
In going on.' 

'Our snow-storms as a rule 
Aren't looked on as man-killers, and although 
I'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep 
Under it all, his door sealed up and lost, 
Than the man fighting it to keep above it, 
Yet think of the small birds at roost and not 
In nests. Shall I be counted less than they are? 
Their bulk in water would be frozen rock 
In no time out to-night. And yet to-morrow 
They will come budding boughs from tree to tree 
Flirting their wings and saying Chickadee, 
As if not knowing what you meant by the word 
storm.' 

167 



'But why when no one wants you to go on? 
Your wifeshe doesn't want you to. We don't, 
And you yourself don't want to. Who else is there?' 

'Save us from being cornered by a woman. 

Well, there's' She told Fred afterward that in 

The pause right there, she thought the dreaded word 

Was coming, 'God/ But no, he only said 

' Well, there's the storm. That says I must go on. 

That wants me as a war might if it came. 

Ask any man/ 

He threw her that as something 
To last her till he got outside the door. 
He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off. 
When Cole returned he found his wife still standing 
Beside the table near the open book, 
Not reading it. 

'Well, what kind of a man 
Do you call that?' she said. 

'He had the gift 
Of words, or is it tongues, I ought to say? ; 

* Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?' 

'Ov disregarding people's civil questions 

What? We've found out in one hour more about him 

Than we had seeing him pass by in the road 

168 



A thousand times. If that's the way he preaches! 
You didn't think you'd keep him after all. 
Oh, I'm not blaming you. He didn't leave you 
Much say in the matter, and I'm just as glad 
We're not in for a night of him. No sleep 
If he had stayed. The least thing set him going. 
It's quiet as an empty church without him.' 

'But how much better off are we as it is? 
We'll have to sit here till we know he's safe.' 

'Yes, I suppose you'll want to, but I shouldn't. 
He knows what he can do, or he wouldn't try. 
Get into bed I say, and get some rest. 
He won't come back, and if he telephones, 
It won't be for an hour or two.' 

' Well then. 

We can't be any help by sitting here 
And living his fight through with him, I suppose.' 



Cole had been telephoning in the dark. 
Mrs. Cole's voice came from an inner room: 
'Did she call you or you call her?' 

'She me. 

You'd better dress: you won't go back to bed. 
We must have been asleep: it's three and after/ 

169 



'Had she been ringing long? FI1 get my wrapper. 
I want to speak to her/ 

'All she said was, 
He hadn't come and had he really started/ 

'She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago/ 
'He had the shovel. He'll have made a fight/ 
'Why did I ever let him leave this house 1 / 

'Don't begin that. You did the best you could 
To keep him though perhaps you didn't quite 
Conceal a wish to see him show the spunk 
To disobey you. Much his wife'll thank you/ 

'Fred, after all I said! You shan't make out 
That it was any way but what it was. 
Did she let on by any word she said 
She didn't thank me?' 

'When I told her "Gone," 

ll Wdlthcn/ > shcsaid,and"Wcllthcn"-likcathrcat. 
And then her voice came scraping slow: "Oh, you, 
Why did you let him go?" ' 

'Asked why we let him? 
You let me there. Fll ask her why she let him. 

170 



She didn't dare to speak when he was here 

Their number's twenty-one? The thing won't work 

Someone's receiver's down. The handle stumbles. 

The stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm! 

It's theirs. She's dropped it from her hand and gone, 

Try speaking. Say "Hello!" ' 

'Hello. Hello/ 
'What do you hear?' 

'I hear an empty room 

You know it sounds that way. And yes, I hear 
I think I hear a clock and windows rattling. 
No step though. If she's there she's sitting down/ 

'Shout; she may hear you/ 

'Shouting is no good/ 
'Keep speaking then/ 

'Hello. Hello. Hello. 
You don't suppose? She wouldn't go out doors?' 

Tm half afraid that's just what she might do/ 

'And leave the children?' 

171 



' Wait and call again. 

You can't hear whether she has left the door 
Wide open and the wind's blown out the lamp 
And the fire's died and the room's dark and cold?' 

'One of two things, either she's gone to bed 
Or gone out doors.' 

'In which case both are lost. 

Do you know what she's like? Have you ever met her? 
It's strange she doesn't want to speak to us/ 

'Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come/ 
'A clock maybe/ 

'Don't you hear something else?' 
'Not talking/ 

'No/ 

' Why, yes, I hear what is it?' 
' What do you say it is?' 

'A baby's crying! 

Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off. 
Its mother wouldn't let it cry like that, 
Not if she's there/ 

172 



* What do you make of it?' 

there's only one thing possible to make, 

That is, assuming that she has gone out. 

Of course she hasn't though.' They both sat down 

Helpless. 'There's nothing we can do till morning.' 

'Fred, I shan't let you think of going out/ 

'Hold on/ The double bell began to chirp. 

They started up. Fred took the telephone. 

'Hello, Meserve. You're there, then! And your wife? 

Good! Why I asked she didn't seem to answer. 

He says she went to let him in the barn. 

We're glad. Oh, say no more about it, man. 

Drop in and see us when you're passing.' 

'Well, 

She has him then, though what she wants him for 
I don't see.' 

'Possibly not for herself. 
Maybe she only wants him for the children/ 

'The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing. 
What spoiled our night was to him just his fun. 
What did he come in for? To talk and visit? 
Thought he'd just call to tell us it was snowing. 
If he thinks he is going to make our house 
A half-way coffee house 'twixt town and nowhere' 

173 



'I thought you'd feel you'd been too much concerned 
'You think you haven't been concerned yourself.' 

'If you mean he was inconsiderate 
To rout us out to think for him at midnight 
And then take our advice no more than nothing, 
Why, I agree with you. But let's forgive him. 
We've had a share in one night of his life. 
What'll you bet he ever calls again?' 



174 



THE SOUND OF THE TREES 

I wonder about the trees. 

Why do we wish to bear 

Forever the noise of these 

More than another noise 

So close to our dwelling place? 

We suffer them by the day 

Till we lose all measure of pace, 

And fixity in our joys, 

And acquire a listening air. 

They are that that talks of going 

But never gets away; 

And that talks no less for knowing, 

As it grows wiser and older, 

That now it means to stay. 

My feet tug at the floor 

And my head sways to my shoulder 

Sometimes when I watch trees sway, 

From the window or the door. 

I shall set forth for somewhere, 

I shall make the reckless choice 

Some day when they are in voice 

And tossing so as to scare 

The white clouds over them on. 

I shall have less to say, 

But I shall be gone. 



175 



New Hampshire 



NEW HAMPSHIRE 

1 met a lady from the South who said 
(You won't believe she said it, but she said it): 
'None of my family ever worked, or had 
A thing to sell/ I don't suppose the work 
Much matters. You may work for all of me. 
I've seen the time I've had to work myself. 
The having anything to sell is what 
Is the disgrace in man or state or nation. 

I met a traveller from Arkansas 

Who boasted of his state as beautiful 

For diamonds and apples. 'Diamonds 

And apples in commercial quantities?' 

I asked him, on my guard. ( Oh yes/ he answered, 

Off his. The time was evening in the Pullman. 

'I see the porter's made your bed/ I told him. 

I met a Californian who would 

Talk California a state so blessed, 

He said, in climate, none had ever died there 

A natural death, and Vigilance Committees 

Had had to organize to stock the graveyards 

And vindicate the state's humanity. 

'Just the way Steffanson runs on/ I murmured, 

'About the British Arctic. That's what comes 

Of being in the market with a climate.' 

179 



I met a poet from another state, 
A zealot full of fluid inspiration, 
Who in the name of fluid inspiration, 
But in the best style of bad salesmanship, 
Angrily tried to make me write a protest 
(In verse I think) against the Volstead Act. 
He didn't even offer me a drink 
Until I asked for one to steady him. 
This is called having an idea to sell. 

It never could have happened in New Hampshire. 

The only person really soiled with trade 

I ever stumbled on in old New Hampshire 

Was someone who had just come back ashamed 

From selling things in California. 

He'd built a noble mansard roof with balls 

On turrets like Constantinople, deep 

In woods some ten miles from a railroad station, 

As if to put forever out of mind 

The hope of being, as we say, received. 

I found him standing at the close of day 

Inside the threshold of his open barn, 

Like a lone actor on a gloomy stage 

&nd recognized him through the iron grey 

In which his face was muffled to the eyes 

As an old boyhood friend, and once indeed 

A drover with me on the road to Brighton. 

His farm was 'grounds,' and not a farm at all; 

His house among the local sheds and shanties 

180 



Rose like a factor's at a trading station. 

And he was rich, and I was still a rascal. 

I couldn't keep from asking impolitely, 

Where had he been and what had he been doing? 

How did he get so? (Rich was understood.) 

In dealing in 'old rags' in San Francisco. 

Oh it was terrible as well could be. 

We both of us turned over in our graves. 

Just specimens is all New Hampshire has, 

One each of everything as in a show-case 

Which naturally she doesn't care to sell 

She had one President (pronounce him Purse, 
And make the most of it for better or worse. 
He's your one chance to score against the state), 
She had one Daniel Webster. He was all 
The Daniel Webster ever was or shall be. 
She had the Dartmouth needed to produce him. 

I call her old. She has one family 
Whose claim is good to being settled here 
Before the era of colonization, 
And before that of exploration even. 
John Smith remarked them as he coasted by 
Dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf 
At the Isles of Shoals, and satisfied himself 
They weren't Red Indians, but veritable 
Pre-primitives of the white race, dawn people, 
Like those who furnished Adam's sons with 
wives; 



However uninnocent they may have been 

In being there so early in our history. 

They'd been there then a hundred years or more. 

Pity he didn't ask what they were up to 

At that date with a wharf already built, 

And take their name. They've since told me their 

name- 
Today an honored one in Nottingham. 
As for what they were up to more than fishing- 
Suppose they weren't behaving Puritanly, 
The hour had not yet struck for being good, 
Mankind had not yet gone on the Sabbatical. 
It became an explorer of the deep 
Not to explore too deep in others' business. 
Did you but know of him, New Hampshire has. 
One real reformer who would change the world 
So it would be accepted by two classes, 
Artists the minute they set up as artists, 
Before, that is, they are themselves accepted, 
And boys the minute they get out of college. 
I can't help thinking those are tests to go by. 

And she has one I don't know what to call him, 
Who comes from Philadelphia every year 
With a great flock of chickens of rare breeds 
He wants to give the educational 
Advantages of growing almost wild 
Under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle- 
Dorkings because they're spoken of by Chaucer 
Sussex because they're spoken of by Herrick. 

182 



She has a touch of gold. New Hampshire gold 

You may have heard of it. I had a farm 

Offered me not long since up Berlin way 

With a mine on it that was worked for gold; 

But not gold in commercial quantities. 

Just enough gold to make the engagement rings 

And marriage rings of those who owned the farm. 

What gold more innocent could one have asked for? 

One of my children ranging after rocks 

Lately brought home from Andover or Canaan 

A specimen of beryl with a trace 

Of radium. I know with radium 

The trace would have to be the merest trace 

To be below the threshold of commercial; 

But trust New Hampshire not to have enough 

Of radium or anything to sell. 

A specimen of everything, I said. 

She has one witch old style. She lives in Colebrook. 

(The only other witch I ever met 

Was lately at a cut-glass dinner in Boston. 

There were four candles and four people present. 

The witch was young, and beautiful (new style), 

And open-minded. She was free to question 

Her gift for reading letters locked in boxes. 

Why was it so much greater when the boxes 

Were metal than it was when they were wooden? 

It made the world seem so mysterious. 

The S'ciety for Psychical Research 

Was cognizant. Her husband was worth millions. 

I think he owned some shares in Harvard College.) 

183 



New Hampshire used to have at Salem 

A company we called the White Corpuscles, 

Whose duty was at any hour of night 

To rush in sheets and fools* caps where they smelled 

A thing the least bit doubtfully perscented 

And give someone the Skipper Ireson's Ride. 

One each of everything as in a show-case. 

More than enough land for a specimen 

You'll say she has, but there there enters in 

Something else to protect her from herself. 

There quality makes up for quantity. 

Not even New Hampshire farms are much for sale. 

The farm I made my home on in the mountains 

I had to take by force rather than buy. 

I caught the owner outdoors by himself 

Raking up after winter, and I said, 

I'm going to put you off this farm: I want it/ 

* Where are you going to put me? In the road?* 

Tm going to put you on the farm next to it.' 

Why won't the farm next to it do for you?' 

1 like this better/ It was really better. 

Apples? New Hampshire has them, but unsprayed, 

With no suspicion in stem-end or blossom-end 

Of vitriol or arsenate of lead, 

And so not good for anything but cider. 

Her unpruned grapes are flung like lariats 

Far up the birches out of reach of man. 

184 



A state producing precious metals, stones, 
And writing; none of these except perhaps 
The precious literature in quantity 
Or quality to worry the producer 
About disposing of it. Do you know, 
Considering the market, there are more 
Poems produced than any other thing? 
No wonder poets sometimes have to seem 
So much more business-like than business men. 
Their wares are so much harder to get rid of. 

She's one of the two best states in the Union. 

Vermont's the other. And the two have been 

Yoke-fellows in the sap-yoke from of old 

In many Marches. And they lie like wedges, 

Thick end to thin end and thin end to thick end, 

And are a figure of the way the strong 

Of mind and strong of arm should fit together, 

One thick where one is thin and vice versa. 

New Hampshire raises the Connecticut 

In a trout hatchery near Canada, 

But soon divides the river with Vermont. 

Both are delightful states for their absurdly 

Small townsLost Nation, Bungey, Muddy Boo, 

Poplin, Still Corners (so called not becaiise 

The place is silent all day long, nor yet 

Because it boasts a whisky still because 

It set out once to be a city and still 

Is only corners, cross- roads in a wood). 

185 



And I remember one whose name appeared 
Between the pictures on a movie screen 
Election night once in Franconia, 
When everything had gone Republican 
And Democrats were sore in need of comfort: 
Easton goes Democratic, Wilson 4 
Hughes 2. And everybody to the saddest 
Laughed the loud laugh, the big laugh at the little. 
New York (five million) laughs at Manchester, 
Manchester (sixty or seventy thousand) laughs 
At Littleton (four thousand), Littleton 
Laughs at Franconia (seven hundred), and 
Franconia laughs, I fear, -did laugh that night 
At Easton. What has Easton left to laugh at, 
And like the actress exclaim, 'Oh my God' at? 
There's Bungey; and for Bungey there are towns, 
Whole townships named but without population. 

Anything I can say about New Hampshire 
Will serve almost as well about Vermont, 
Excepting that they differ in their mountains. 
The Vermont mountains stretch extended straight; 
New Hampshire mountains curl up in a coil. 

I had been coming to New Hampshire mountains. 

And here I am and what am I to say? 

Here first my theme becomes embarrassing. 

Emerson said, 'The God who made New Hampshire 

Taunted the lofty land with little men.' 

Another Massachusetts poet said, 

186 



'I go no more to summer in New Hampshire. 

IVe given up my summer place in Dublin/ 

But when I asked to know what ailed New Hampshire. 

She said she couldn't stand the people in it, 

The little men (it's Massachusetts speaking). 

And when I asked to know what ailed the people, 

She said, 'Go read your own books and find out.' 

I may as well confess myself the author 

Of several books against the world in general. 

To take them as against a special state 

Or even nation's to restrict my meaning. 

I'm what is called a sensibilitist, 

Or otherwise an environmentalist. 

I refuse to adapt myself a mite 

To any change from hot to cold, from wet 

To dry, from poor to rich, or back again. 

I make a virtue of my suffering 

From nearly everything that goes on round me. 

In other words, I know wherever I am, 

Being the creature of literature I am, 

I shall not lack for pain to keep me awake. 

Kit Marlowe taught me how to say my prayers: 

'Why, this is Hell, nor am I out of it/ 

Samoa, Russia, Ireland I complain of, 

No less than England, France and Italy. 

Because I wrote my novels in New Hampshire 

Is no proof that I aimed them at New Hampshire. 



When I left Massachusetts years ago 
Between two days, the reason why I sought 



187 



New Hampshire, not Connecticut, 

Rhode Island, New York, or Vermont was this: 

Where I was living then, New Hampshire offered 

The nearest boundary to escape across. 

I hadn't an illusion in my hand-bag 

About the people being better there 

Than those I left behind. I thought they weren't. 

I thought they couldn't be. And yet they were. 

I'd sure had no such friends in Massachusetts 

As Hall of Windham, Gay of Atkinson, 

Bartlett of Raymond (now of Colorado), 

Harris of Derry, and Lynch of Bethlehem 

The glorious bards of Massachusetts seem 

To want to make New Hampshire people over. 

They taunt the lofty land with little men. 

I don't know what to say about the people. 

For art's sake one could almost wish them worse 

Rather than better. How are we to write 

The Russian novel in America 

As long as life goes so unterribly? 

There is the pinch from which our only outcry 

In literature to date is heard to come. 

We get what little misery we can 

Out of not having cause for misery. 

It makes the guild of novel writers sick 

To be expected to be Dostoievskis 

On nothing worse than too much luck and comfort. 

This is not sorrow, though; it's just the vapors, 

And recognized as such in Russia itself 

188 



Under the new regime, and so forbidden. 
If well it is with Russia, then feel free 
To say so or be stood against the wall 
And shot. It's Pollyanna now or death. 
This, then, is the new freedom we hear tell of; 
And very sensible. No state can build 
A literature that shall at once be sound 
And sad on a foundation of well-being, 

To show the level of intelligence 

Among us: it was just a Warren farmer 

Whose horse had pulled him short up in the road 

By me, a stranger. This is what he said, 

From nothing but embarrassment and want 

Of anything more sociable to say: 

' You hear those hound-dogs sing on Moosilauke? 

Well they remind me of the hue and cry 

We've heard against the Mid- Victorians 

And never rightly understood till Bryan 

Retired from politics and joined the chorus. 

The matter with the Mid- Victorians 

Seems to have been a man named John L. Darwin/ 

'Go 'long/ I said to him, he to his horse. 

I knew a man who failing as a farmer 

Burned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance. 

And spent the proceeds on a telescope 

To satisfy a life-long curiosity 

About our place among the infinities. 

And how was that for other-worldliness? 

189 



If I must choose which I would elevate 
The people or the already lofty mountains, 
Td elevate the already lofty mountains. 
The only fault I find with old New Hampshire 
Is that her mountains aren't quite high enough. 
I was not always so; I've come to be so. 
How, to my sorrow, how have I attained 
A height from which to look down critical 
On mountains? What has given me assurance 
To say what height becomes New Hampshire moun- 
tains, 

Or any mountains? Can it be some strength 
I feel as of an earthquake in my back 
To heave them higher to the morning star? 
Can it be foreign travel in the Alps? 
Or having seen and credited a moment 
The solid moulding of vast peaks of cloud 
Behind the pitiful reality 
Of Lincoln, Lafayette and Liberty? 
Or some such sense as says how high shall jet 
The fountain in proportion to the basin? 
No, none of these has raised me to my throne 
Of intellectual dissatisfaction, 
But the sad accident of having seen 
Our actual mountains given in a map 
Of early times as twice the height they are- 
Ten thousand feet instead of only five 
Which shows how sad an accident may be. 
Five thousand is no longer high enough. 
Whereas I never had a good idea 

190 



About improving people in the world, 

Here I am over-fertile in suggestion, 

And cannot rest from planning day or night 

How high Fd thrust the peaks in summer snow 

To tap the upper sky and draw a flow 

Of frosty night air on the vale below 

Down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry. 

The more the sensibilitist I am 
The more I seem to want my mountains wild; 
The way the wiry gang-boss liked the log-jam. 
After he'd picked the lock and got it started, 
He dodged a log that lifted like an arm 
Against the sky to break his back for him, 
Then came in dancing, skipping, with his life 
Across the roar and chaos, and the words 
We saw him say along the zigzag journey 
Were doubtless as the words we heard him say 
On coming nearer: 'Wasn't she an i-deal 
Son-of-a-bitch? You bet she was an t-deal.' 

For all her mountains fall a little short, 
Her people not quite short enough for Art, 
She's still New Hampshire, a most restful state. 

Lately in converse with a New York alec 
About the new school of the pseudo-phallic, 
I found myself in a close corner where 
I had to make an almost funny choice. 
'Choose you which you will bea prude, or puke, 

191 



Mewling and puking in the public arms/ 
'Me for the hills where I don't have to choose/ 
'But if you had to choose, which would you be?' 
I wouldn't be a prude afraid of nature. 
I know a man who took a double axe 
And went alone against a grove of trees; 
But his heart failing him, he dropped the axe 
And ran for shelter quoting Matthew Arnold: 
'Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood; 
There's been enough shed without shedding mine. 
Remember Birnam Wood! The wood's in flux!' 
He had a special terror of the flux 
That showed itself in dendrophobia. 
The only decent tree had been to mill 
And educated into boards, he said. 
He knew too well for any earthly use 
The line where man leaves off and nature starts, 
And never over-stepped it save in dreams. 
He stood on the safe side of the line talking; 
Which is sheer Matthew Arnoldism, 
The cult of one who owned himself 'a foiled, 
Circuitous wanderer,' and 'took dejectedly 
His seat upon the intellectual throne/ 
Agreed in frowning on these improvised 
Altars the woods are full of nowadays, 
Again as in the days when Ahaz sinned 
By worship under green trees in the open. 
Scarcely a mile but that I come on one, 
A black-cheeked stone and stick of rain-washed 
charcoal 

192 



Even to say the groves were God's first temples 

Comes too near to Ahaz' sin for safety. 

Nothing not built with hands of course is sacred. 

But here is not a question of what's sacred; 

Rather of what to face or run away from. 

I'd hate to be a runaway from nature. 

And neither would I choose to be a puke 

Who cares not what he does in company, 

And, when he can't do anything, falls back 

On words, and tries his worst to make words speak 

Louder than actions, and sometimes achieves it. 

It seems a narrow choice the age insists on. 

How about being a good Greek, for instance? 

That course, they tell me, isn't offered this year. 

'Come, but this isn't choosing puke or prude?' 

Well, if I have to choose one or the other, 

I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer 

With an income in cash of say a thousand 

(From say a publisher in New York City). 

It's restful to arrive at a decision, 

And restful just to think about New Hampshire. 

At present I am living in Vermont. 



193 



A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT 
(For Lincoln MacVeagh) 

L Sever tell me that not one star of all 

That slip from heaven at night and softly fall 

Has been picked up with stones to build a wall. 

Some laborer found one faded and stone cold, 
And saving that its weight suggested gold, 
And tugged it from his first too certain hold, 

He noticed nothing in it to remark. 

He was not used to handling stars thrown dark 

And lifeless from an interrupted arc. 

He did not recognize in that smooth coal 
The one thing palpable besides the soul 
To penetrate the air in which we roll. 

He did not see how like a flying thing 

It brooded ant-eggs, and had one large wing, 

One not so large for flying in a ring, 

And a long Bird of Paradise's tail, 

(Though these when not in use to fly and trail 

It drew back in its body like a snail); 

Nor know that he might move it from the spot, 
The harm was done; from having been star-shot 
The very nature of the soil was hot 

194 



And burning to yield flowers instead of grain, 
Flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain 
Poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain. 

He moved it roughly with an iron bar, 
He loaded an old stone-boat with the star 
And not, as you might think, a flying car, 

Such as even poets would admit perforce 
More practical than Pegasus the horse 
If it could put a star back in its course. 

He dragged it through the ploughed ground at a pace 
But faintly reminiscent of the race 
Of jostling rock in interstellar space. 

It went for building stone, and I, as though 

Commanded in a dream, forever go 

To right the wrong that this should have been so. 

Yet ask where else it could have gone as well, 
I do not know I cannot stop to tell: 
He might have left it lying where it fell. 

From following walls I never lift my eye 
Except at night to places in the sky 
Where showers of charted meteors let fly. 



195 



Some may know what they seek in school and church, 
And why they seek it there; for what I search 
I must go measuring stone walls, perch on perch; 

Sure that though not a star of death and birth, 
So not to be compared, perhaps, in worth 
To such resorts of life as Mars and Earth, 

Though not, I say, a star of death and sin, 
It yet has poles, and only needs a spin 
To show its worldly nature and begin 

To chafe and shuffle in my calloused palm 
And run off in strange tangents with my arm 
As fish do with the line in first alarm. 

Such as it is, it promises the prize 
Of the one world complete in any size 
That I am like to compass, fool or wise. 



THE CENSUS-TAKER 

1 came an errand one cloud-blowing evening 

To a slab-built, black-paper-covered house 

Of one room and one window and one door, 

The only dwelling in a waste cut over 

A hundred square miles round it in the mountains: 

And that not dwelt in now by men or women. 

(Ir never had been dwelt in, though, by women, 

So what is this I make a sorrow of?) 

I came as census-taker to the waste 

To count the people in it and found none, 

None in the hundred miles, none in the house, 

Where I came last with some hope, but not much 

After hours' overlooking from the cliffs 

An emptiness flayed to the very stone. 

I found no people that dared show themselves, 

None not in hiding from the outward eye. 

The time was autumn, but how anyone 

Could tell the time of year when every tree 

That could have dropped a leaf was down itself 

And nothing but the stump of it was left 

Now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch; 

And every tree up stood a rotting trunk 

Without a single leaf to spend on autumn, 

Or branch to whistle after what was spent. 

Perhaps the wind the more without the help 

Of breathing trees said something of the time 

Of year or day the way it swung a door 

197 



Forever off the latch, as if rude men 

Passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him 

For the next one to open for himself. 

I counted nine I had no right to count 

(But this was dreamy unofficial counting) 

Before I made the tenth across the threshold. 

Where was my supper? Where was anyone's? 

No lamp was lit. Nothing was on the table. 

The stove was cold the stove was off the chimney 

And down by one side where it lacked a leg. 

The people that had loudly passed the door 

Were people to the ear but not the eye. 

They were not on the table with their elbows. 

They were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks. 

I saw no men there and no bones of men there. 

I armed myself against such bones as might be 

With the pitch-blackened stub of an axe-handle 

I picked up off the straw-dust covered floor. 

Not bones, but the ill-fitted window rattled. 

The door was still because I held it shut 

While I thought what to do that could be done 

About the house about the people not there. 

This house in one year fallen to decay 

Filled me with no less sorrow than the houses 

Fallen to ruin in ten thousand years 

Where Asia wedges Africa from Europe. 

Nothing was left to do that I could see 

Unless to find that there was no one there 

And declare to the cliffs too far for echo, 

f The place is desert and let whoso lurks 

198 



In silence, if in this he is aggrieved, 

Break silence now or be forever silent. 

Let him say why it should not be declared so/ 

The melancholy of having to count souls 

Where they grow fewer and fewer every year 

Is extreme where they shrink to none at all. 

It must be I want life to go on living. 



199 



THE STAR-SPLITTER 

< You know Orion always comes up sideways. 
Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains. 
And rising on his hands, he looks in on me 
Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something 
I should have done by daylight, and indeed, 
After the ground is frozen, I should have done 
Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful 
Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney 
To make fun of my way of doing things, 
Or else fun of Orion's having caught me. 
Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights 
These forces are obliged to pay respect to?' 
So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk 
Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming, 
Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming, 
He burned his house down for the fire insurance 
And spent the proceeds on a telescope 
To satisfy a life-long curiosity 
About our place among the infinities. 

What do you want with one of those blame things?' 

I asked him well beforehand. 'Don't you get one!' 

'Don't call it blamed; there isn't anything 

More blameless in the sense of being less 

A weapon in our human fight/ he said. 

Til have one if I sell my farm to buy it.' 

There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground 

200 



And plowed between the rocks he couldn't move, 

Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years 

Trying to sell his farm and then not selling, 

He burned his house down for the fire insurance 

And bought the telescope with what it came to. 

He had been heard to say by several: 

'The best thing that we're put here for's to see; 

The strongest thing that's given us to see with's 

A telescope. Someone in every town 

Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one. 

In Littleton it may as well be me/ 

After such loose talk it was no surprise 

When he did what he did and burned his house down, 

Mean laughter went about the town that day 

To let him know we weren't the least imposed on, 

And he could wait we'd see to him to-morrow. 

But the first thing next morning we reflected 

If one by one we counted people out 

For the least sin, it wouldn't take us long 

To get so we had no one left to live with. 

For to be social is to be forgiving. 

Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,s, 

We don't cut off from coming to church supper 

But what we miss we go to him and ask for. 

He promptly gives it back, that is if still 

Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of. 

It wouldn't do to be too hard on Brad 

About his telescope. Beyond the age 

Of being given one's gift for Christmas, 

2O1 



He had to take the best way he knew how 
To find himself in one. \Vell, all we said was 
He took a strange thing to be roguish over. 
Some sympathy was wasted on the house, 
A good old-timer dating back along; 
But a house isn't sentient; the house 
Didn't feel anything. And if it did, 
Why not regard it as a sacrifice, 
And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire, 
Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction? 

Out of a house and so out of a farm 

At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn 

To earn a living on the Concord railroad, 

As under-ticket-agent at a station 

Where his job, when he wasn't selling tickets, 

\Vas setting out up track and down, not plants 

As on a farm, but planets, evening stars 

That varied in their hue from red to green. 

He got a good glass for six hundred dollars. 

His new job gave him leisure for star-gazing 

Often he bid me come and have a look 

Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside, 

At a star quaking in the other end. 

I recollect a night of broken clouds 

And underfoot snow melted down to ice, 

And melting further in the wind to mud. 

Bradford and I had out the telescope. 

^Ve spread our two legs as we spread its three, 

202 



Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it, 

And standing at our leisure till the day broke, 

Said some of the best things we ever said. 

That telescope was christened the Star-splitter, 

Because it didn't do a thing but split 

A star in two or three the way you split 

A globule of quicksilver in your hand 

With one stroke of your finger in the middle. 

It's a star-splitter if there ever was one 

And ought to do some good if splitting stars 

'Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood. 

We've looked and looked, but after all where are we? 

Do we know any better where we are, 

And how it stands between the night to-night 

And a man with a smoky lantern chimney? 

How different from the way it ever stood? 



203 



THE AXE-HELVE 

I've known ere now an interfering branch 

Of alder catch my lifted axe behind me. 

But that was in the woods, to hold my hand 

From striking at another alder's roots, 

And that was, as I say, an alder branch. 

This was a man, Baptiste, who stole one day 

Behind me on the snow in my own yard 

Where I was working at the chopping-block, 

And cutting nothing not cut down already. 

He caught my axe expertly on the rise, 

When all my strength put forth was in his favor, 

Held it a moment where it was, to calm me, 

Then took it from me and I let him take it. 

I didn't know him well enough to know 

What it was all about. There might be something 

He had in mind to say to a bad neighbor 

He might prefer to say to him disarmed. 

But all he had to tell me in French-English 

Was what he thought of not me, but my axe; 

Me only as I took my axe to heart. 

It was the bad axe-helve some one had sold me 

'Made on machine/ he said, ploughing the grain 

With a thick thumbnail to show how it ran 

Across the handle's long drawn serpentine, 

Like the two strokes across a dollar sign. 

'You give her one good crack, she's snap raght off. 

Den where's your hax-ead flying through de hair?' 

Admitted; and yet, what was that to him? 

204 



'Come on my house and I put you one in 

What's las' awhile good hick'ry what's grow 

crooked, 

De second growt' I cut myself tough, tough!' 
Something to sell? That wasn't how it sounded. 

'Den when you say you come? It's cost you nothing 
To-naght?' 

As well to-night as any night. 

Beyond an over-warmth of kitchen stove 

My welcome differed from no other welcome. 

Baptiste knew best why I was where I was. 

So long as he would leave enough unsaid, 

I shouldn't mind his being overjoyed 

(If overjoyed he was) at having got me 

Where I must judge if what he knew about an axe 

That not everybody else knew was to count 

For nothing in the measure of a neighbor. 

Hard if, though cast away for life with Yankees, 

A Frenchman couldn't get his human rating! 

Mrs. Baptiste came in and rocked a chair 
That had as many motions as the world: 
One back and forward, in and out of shadow, 
That got her nowhere; one more gradual, 
Sideways, that would have run her on the stove 
In time, had she not realized her danger 
And caught herself up bodily, chair and all, 

20 s 



And set herself back where she started from. 
'She ain't spick too much Henglishdat's too bad/ 

I was afraid, in brightening first on me, 
Then on Baptiste, as if she understood 
What passed between us, she was only feigning. 
Baptiste was anxious for her; but no more 
Than for himself, so placed he couldn't hope 
To keep his bargain of the morning with me 
In time to keep me from suspecting him 
Of really never having meant to keep it. 

Needlessly soon he had his axe-helves out, 
A quiverful to choose from, since he wished me 
To have the best he had, or had to spare- 
Not for me to ask which, when what he took 
Had beauties he had to point me out at length 
To insure their not being wasted on me. 
He liked to have it slender as a whipstock, 
Free from the least knot, equal to the strain 
Of bending like a sword across the knee. 
He showed me that the lines of a good helve 
Were native to the grain before the knife 
Expressed them, and its curves were no false curves 
Put on it from without. And there its strength lay 
For the hard work. He chafed its long white body 
From end to end with his rough hand shut round it. 
He tried it at the eye-hole in the axe -head. 
'Hahn, hahn/ he mused, 'don't need much taking 
down/ 

206 



Baptiste knew how to make a short job long 
For love of it, and yet not waste time either. 

Do you know, what we talked about was knowledge? 

Baptiste on his defence about the children 

He kept from school, or did his best to keep 

Whatever school and children and our doubts 

Of laid-on education had to do 

With the curves of his axe-helves and his having 

Used these unscrupulously to bring me 

To see for once the inside of his house. 

Was I desired in friendship, partly as some one 

To leave it to, whether the right to hold 

Such doubts of education should depend 

Upon the education of those who held them? 

But now he brushed the shavings from his knee 
And stood the axe there on its horse's hoof, 
Erect, but not without its waves, as when 
The snake stood up for evil in the Garden, 
Top-heavy with a heaviness his short, 
Thick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down 
And in a little a French touch in that. 
Baptiste drew back and squinted at it, pleased; 
'See how she's cock her head!' 



20? 



THE GRINDSTONE 

rlaving a wheel and four legs of its own 
Has never availed the cumbersome grindstone 
To get it anywhere that I can see. 
These hands have helped it go, and even race; 
Not all the motion, though, they ever lent, 
Not all the miles it may have thought it went, 
Have got it one step from the starting place. 
It stands beside the same old apple tree. 
The shadow of the apple tree is thin 
Upon it now, its feet are fast in snow. 
All other farm machinery's gone in, 
And some of it on no more legs and wheel 
Than the grindstone can boast to stand or go, 
(I'm thinking chiefly of the wheelbarrow.) 
For months it hasn't known the taste of steel, 
Washed down with rusty water in a tin. 
But standing outdoors hungry, in the cold, 
Except in towns at night, is not a sin. 
And, anyway, its standing in the yard 
Under a ruinous live apple tree 
Has nothing any more to do with me, 
Except that I remember how of old 
One summer day. all day I drove it hard, 
And someone mounted on it rode it hard, 
And he and I between us ground a blade. 

1 gave it the preliminary spin, 

And poured on water (tears it might have been); 

2O? 



And when it almost gayly jumped and flowed, 

A Father-Time-like man got on and rode, 

Armed with a scythe and spectacles that glowed. 

He turned on will-power to increase the load 

And slow me down and I abruptly slowed, 

Like coming to a sudden railroad station. 

I changed from hand to hand in desperation. 

I wondered what machine of ages gone 

This represented an improvement on. 

For all I knew it may have sharpened spears 

And arrowheads itself. Much use for years 

Had gradually worn it an oblate 

Spheroid that kicked and struggled in its gait, 

Appearing to return me hate for hate; 

(But I forgive it now as easily 

As any other boyhood enemy 

Whose pride has failed to get him anywhere). 

I wondered who it was the man thought ground 

The one who held the wheel back or the one 

Who gave his life to keep it going round? 

I wondered if he really thought it fair 

For him to have the say when we were done. 

Such were the bitter thoughts to which I turned. 

Not for myself was I so much concerned. 

Oh no! -although, of course, I could have found 

A better way to pass the afternoon 

Than grinding discord out of a grindstone, 

And beating insects at their gritty tune. 

Nor was I for the man so much concerned. 

209 



Once when the grindstone almost jumped its bearing 

It looked as if he might be badly thrown 

And wounded on his blade. So far from caring, 

I laughed inside, and only cranked the faster, 

(It ran as if it wasn't greased but glued); 

I'd welcome any moderate disaster 

That might be calculated to postpone 

What evidently nothing could conclude. 

The thing that made me more and more afraid 

Was that we'd ground it sharp and hadn't known. 

And now were only wasting precious blade. 

And when he raised it dripping once and tried 

The creepy edge of it with wary touch, 

And viewed it over his glasses funny-eyed, 

Only disinterestedly to decide 

It needed a turn more, I could have cried 

Wasn't there danger of a turn too much? 

Mightn't we make it worse instead of better? 

I was for leaving something to the whetter. 

What if it wasn't all it should be? I'd 

Be satisfied if he'd be satisfied.

CAUL'S WIFE 

1 o drive Paul out of any lumber camp 
All that was needed was to say to him, 
'How is the wife, Paul?' and he'd disappear. 
Some said it was because he had no wife, 
And hated to be twitted on the subject. 
Others because he'd come within a day 
Or so of having one, and then been jilted. 
Others because he'd had one once, a good one, 
Who'd run away with some one else and left him. 
And others still because he had one now 
He only had to be reminded of, 
He was all duty to her in a minute: 
He had to run right off to look her up, 
As if to say, 'That's so, how is my wife? 
I hope she isn't getting into mischief.' 
No one was anxious to get rid of Paul. 
He'd been the hero of the mountain camps 
Ever since, just to show them, he had slipped 
The bark of a whole tamarack off whole, 
As clean as boys do off a willow twig 
To make a willow whistle on a Sunday 
In April by subsiding meadow brooks. 
They seemed to ask him just to see him go, 
'How is the wife, Paul?' and he always went. 
He never stopped to murder anyone 
Who asked the question. He just disappeared- 
Nobody knew in what direction, 
Although it wasn't usually long 

211 



Before they heard of him in some new camp, 
The same Paul at the same old feats of logging. 
The question everywhere was why should Paul 
Object to being asked a civil question 
A man you could say almost anything to 
Short of a fighting word. You have the answers. 
And there was one more not so fair to Paul: 
That Paul had married a wife not his equal. 
Paul was ashamed of her. To match a hero, 
She would have had to be a heroine; 
Instead of which she was some half-breed squaw. 
But if the story Murphy told was true, 
She wasn't anything to be ashamed of. 

You know Paul could do wonders. Everyone's 
Heard how he thrashed the horses on a load 
That wouldn't budge until they simply stretched 
Their rawhide harness from the load to camp. 
Paul told the boss the load would be all right, 
'The sun will bring your load in'and it did 
By shrinking the rawhide to natural length. 
That's what is called a stretcher. But I guess 
The one about his jumping so's to land 
With both his feet at once against the Ceiling, 
And then land safely right side up again, 
Back on the floor, is fact or pretty near fact. 
Well this is such a yarn. Paul sawed his wife 
Out of a white-pine log. Murphy was there, 
And, as you might say, saw the lady born. 
Paul worked at anything in lumbering. 

212 



He'd been hard at it taking boards away 

For I forgetthe last ambitious sawyer 

To want to find out if he couldn't pile 

The lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy 

They'd sliced the first slab off a big butt log, 

And the sawyer had slammed the carriage back 

To slam end on again against the saw teeth. 

To judge them by the way they caught themselves 

When they saw what had happened to the log, 

They must have had a guilty expectation 

Something was going to go with their slambanging. 

Something had left a broad black streak of grease 

On the new wood the whole length of the log 

Except, perhaps, a foot at either end. 

But when Paul put his finger in the grease, 

It wasn't grease at all, but a long slot. 

The log was hollow. They were sawing pine. 

( First time I ever saw a hollow pine. 

That comes of having Paul around the place. 

Take it to hell for me,' the sawyer said. 

Everyone had to have a look at it, 

And tell Paul what he ought to do about it. 

(They treated it as his.) 'You take a jack-knife, 

And spread the opening, and you've got a dug-out 

All dug to go a-fishing in.' To Paul 

The hollow looked too sound and clean and empty 

Ever to have housed birds or beasts or bees. 

There was no entrance for them to get in by. 

It looked to him like some new kind of hollow 

He thought he'd better take his jack-knife to. 

213 



So after work that evening he came back 

And let enough light into it by cutting 

To see if it was empty. He made out in there 

A slender length of pith, or was it pith? 

It might have been the skin a snake had cast 

And left stood up on end inside the tree 

The hundred years the tree must have been growing 

More cutting and he had this in both hands, 

And, looking from it to the pond near by, 

Paul wondered how it would respond to water. 

Not a breeze stirred, but just the breath of air 

He made in walking slowly to the beach 

Blew it once off his hands and almost broke it. 

He laid it at the edge where it could drink. 

At the first drink it rustled and grew limp. 

At the next drink it grew invisible. 

Paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers, 

And thought it must have melted. It was gone. 

And then beyond the open water, dim with midges, 

Where the log drive lay pressed against the boom, 

It slowly rose a person, rose a girl, 

Her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet, 

Who, leaning on a log looked back at Paul. 

And that made Paul in turn look back 

To see if it was anyone behind him 

That she was looking at instead of him. 

Murphy had been there watching all the time, 

But from a shed where neither of them could sec him 

There was a moment of suspense in birth 

When the girl seemed too water-logged to live, 

Before she caught her first breath with a gasp 

214 



And laughed. Then she climbed slowly to her feet, 
And walked off talking to herself or Paul 
Across the logs like backs of alligators, 
Paul taking after her around the pond. 

Next evening Murphy and some other fellows 

Got drunk, and tracked the pair up Catamount, 

From the bare top of which there is a view 

To other hills across a kettle valley. 

And there, well after dark, let Murphy tell it, 

They saw Paul and his creature keeping house. 

It was the only glimpse that anyone 

Has had of Paul and her since Murphy saw them 

Falling in love across the twilight mill-pond. 

More than a mile across the wilderness 

They sat together half-way up a cliff 

In a small niche let into it, the girl 

Brightly, as if a star played on the place, 

Paul darkly, like her shadow. All the light 

Was from the girl herself, though, not from a star, 

As was apparent from what happened next. 

All those great ruffians put their throats together, 

And let out a loud yell, and threw a bottle, 

As a brute tribute of respect to beauty. 

Of course the bottle fell short by a mile, 

But the shout reached the girl and put her light out, 

She went out like a firefly, and that was all. 

So there were witnesses that Paul was married, 
And not to anyone to be ashamed of. 
Everyone had been wrong in judging Paul. 

215 



Murphy told me Paul put on all those airs 
About his wife to keep her to himself. 
Paul was what's called a terrible possessor. 
Owning a wife with him meant owning her. 
She wasn't anybody else's business, 
Either to praise her, or so much as name her, 
And he'd thank people not to think of her. 
Murphy's idea was that a man like Paul 
Wouldn't be spoken to about a wife 
[n any way the world knew how to speak. 



216 



WILD GRAPES 

What tree may not the fig be gathered from? 
The grape may not be gathered from the birch? 
It's all you know the grape, or know the birch. 
As a girl gathered from the birch myself 
Equally with my weight in grapes, one autumn, 
I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of. 
I \vas born, I suppose, like anyone, 
And grew to be a little boyish girl 
My brother could not always leave at home. 
But that beginning was wiped out in fear 
The day I swung suspended with the grapes, 
And was come after like Eurydice 
And brought down safely from the upper regions; 
And the life I live now's an extra life 
I can waste as I please on whom I please. 
So if you see me celebrate two birthdays, 
And give myself out as two different ages, 
One of them five years younger than I look- 
One day my brother led me to a glade 
Where a white birch he knew of stood alone, 
Wearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves, 
And heavy on her heavy hair behind, 
Against her neck, an ornament of grapes. 
Grapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last 

year. 
One bunch of them, and there began to be 



Bunches all round me growing in white birches, 

The way they grew round Lief the Lucky's German; 

Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though, 

As the moon used to seem when I was younger, 

And only freely to be had for climbing. 

My brother did the climbing; and at first 

Threw me down grapes to miss and scatter 

And have to hunt for in sweet fern and hardhack; 

Which gave him some time to himself to eat, 

But not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed. 

So then, to make me wholly self-supporting, 

He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth, 

And put it in my hands to pick my own grapes. 

'Here, take a tree-top, I'll get down another. 

Hold on with all your might when I let go.' 

I said I had the tree. It wasn't true. 

The opposite was true. The tree had me. 

The minute it was left with me alone 

It caught me up as if I were the fish 

And it the fishpole. So I was translated 

To loud cries from my brother of 'Let go! 

Don't you know anything, you girl? Let go!' 

But I, with something of the baby grip 

Acquired ancestrally in just such trees 

When wilder mothers than our wildest now 

Hung babies out on branches by the hands 

To dry or wash or tan, I don't know which 

(You'll have to ask an evolutionist) 

I held on uncomplainingly for life. 

My brother tried to make me laugh to help me. 

218 



< What are you doing up there in those grapes? 
Don't be afraid. A few of them won't hurt you. 
I mean, they won't pick you if you don't them/ 
Much danger of my picking anything! 
By that time I was pretty well reduced 
To a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang. 
'Now you know how it feels/ my brother said, 
* To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them, 
That when it thinks it has escaped the fox 
By growing where it shouldn't on a birch, 
Where a fox wouldn't think to look for it 
And if he looked and found it, couldn't reach it- 
Just then come you and I to gather it. 
Only you have the advantage of the grapes 
In one way: you have one more stem to cling by, 
And promise more resistance to the picker/ 

One by one I lost off my hat and shoes, 

And still I clung. I let my head fall back, 

And shut my eyes against the sun, my ears 

Against my brother's nonsense; 'Drop/ he said, 

Til catch you in my arms. It isn't far/ 

(Stated in lengths of him it might not be. ) 

'Drop or I'll shake the tree and shake you down/ 

Grim silence on my part as I sank lower, 

My small wrists stretching till they showed the ban* 

jo strings. 

'Why, if she isn't serious about it! 
Hold tight awhile till I think what to do. 
I'll bend the tree down and let you down by it/ 

219 



[ don't know much about the letting down; 
But once I felt ground with my stocking feet 
And the world came revolving back to me, 
I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers. 
Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off. 
My brother said: 'Don't you weigh anything? 
Try to weigh something next time., so you won't 
Be run oft with by birch trees into space/ 

It wasn't my not weighing anything 
So much as my not knowing anything 
My brother had been nearer right before. 
I had not taken the first step in knowledge; 
I had not learned to let go with the hands, 
As still I have not learned to with the heart, 
And have no wish to with the heartnor need, 
That I can see. The mind is not the heart. 
I may yet live, as I know others live, 
To wish in vain to let go with the mind 
Of cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells me 
That I need learn to let go with the heart. 



220 



THE WITCH OF COOS 

I staid the night for shelter at a farm 
Behind the mountain, with a mother and son, 
Two old-believers. They did all the talking. 

MOTHER. Folks think a witch who has familiar 

spirits 

She could call up to pass a winter evening, 
But won't, should be burned at the stake or some^ 

thing. 

Summoning spirits isn't 'Button, button, 
Who's got the button/ 1 would have them know. 

SON. Mother can make a common table rear 
And kick with two legs like an army mule. 

MOTHER. And when I've done it, what good have 

I done? 

Rather than tip a table for you, let me 
Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me, 
He said the dead had souls, but when I asked him 
How could that be I thought the dead were souls, 
He broke my trance. Don't that make you suspicious 
That there's something the dead are keeping back? 
Yes, there's something the dead are keeping back. 

SON. You wouldn't want to tell him what we have 
Up attic, mother? 

221 



MOTHER. Bones a skeleton. 

SON. But the headboard of mother's bed is pushed 

Against the attic door: the door is nailed. 

It's harmless, Mother hears it in the night 

Halting perplexed behind the barrier 

Of door and headboard. Where it wants to get 

Is back into the cellar where it came from. 

MOTHER. We'll never let them, will we, son! We'll 
never! 

SON. It left the cellar forty years ago 

And carried itself like a pile of dishes 

Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen, 

Another from the kitchen to the bedroom, 

Another from the bedroom to the attic, 

Right past both father and mother, and neither 

stopped it. 

Father had gone upstairs; mother was downstairs. 
I was a baby: I don't know where I was. 

MOTHER. The only fault my husband found withme 

I went to sleep before I went to bed, 

Especially in winter when the bed 

Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow. 

The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs 

Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me, 

But left an open door to cool the room off 

So as to sort of turn me out of it. 

222 



I was just coming to myself enough 

To wonder where the cold was coming from, 

When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom 

And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar. 

The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on 

When there was water in the cellar in spring 

Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then someone 

Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step, 

The way a man with one leg and a crutch, 

Or a little child, comes up. It wasn't Toffile: 

It wasn't anyone who could be there. 

The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked 

And swollen tight and buried under snow. 

The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust 

And swollen tight and buried under snow. 

It was the bones. I knew them and good reason. 

My first impulse was to get to the knob 

And hold the door. But the bones didn't try 

The door; they halted helpless on the landing, 

Waiting for things to happen in their favor. 

The faintest restless rustling ran all through them. 

I never could have done the thing I did 

If the wish hadn't been too strong in me 

To see how they were mounted for this walk. 

I had a vision of them put together 

Not like a man, but like a chandelier. 

So suddenly I flung the door wide on him. 

A moment he stood balancing with emotion, 

And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire 

223 



Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth. 

Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.) 

Then he came at me with one hand outstretched, 

The way he did in life once; but this time 

I struck the hand off brittle on the floor, 

And fell back from him on the floor myself. 

The finger-pieces slid in all directions. 

(Where did I see one of those pieces lately^ 

Hand me my button-boxit must be thei c. ) 

I sat up on the floor and shouted, 'Toffil* 1 , 

It's coming up to you.' It had its choice 

Of the door to the cellar or the hall. 

It took the hall door for the novelty, 

And set off briskly for so slow a thing, 

Still going every which way in the joints, though, 

So that it looked like lightning or a scribble, 

From the slap I had just now given its hand. 

I listened till it almost climbed the stairs 

From the hall to the only finished bedroom, 

Before I got up to do anything; 

Then ran and shouted, 'Shut the bedroom door, 

Toffile, for my sake!' ( Company?' he said, 

* Don't make me get up; Pm too warm in bed/ 

So lying forward weakly on the handrail 

I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light 

(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own 

I could see nothing. 'Toffile, I don't see it. 

It's with us in the room though. It's the bones/ 

*What bones?' 'The cellar bones out of the grave/ 

224 



That made him throw his bare legs out of bed 

And sit up by me and take hold of me. 

I wanted to put out the light and see 

If I could see it, or else mow the room, 

With our arms at the level of our knees, 

And bring the chalk-pile down. Til tell you what 

It's looking for another door to try. 

The uncommonly deep snow has made him think 

Of his old song, The Wild Colonial Boy, 

He always used to sing along the tote-road. 

He's after an open door to get out-doors. 

Let's trap him with an open door up attic/ 

Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough, 

Almost the moment he was given an opening, 

The steps began to climb the attic stairs. 

I heard them. Toffile didn't seem to hear them. 

'Quick!' I slammed to the door and held the knob, 

'Toffile, get nails/ I made him nail the door shut 

And push the headboard of the bed against it. 

Then we asked was there anything 

Up attic that we'd ever want again. 

The attic was less to us than the cellar. 

If the bones liked the attic, let them have it. 

Let them stay in the attic. When they sometimes 

Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed 

Behind the door and headboard of the bed, 

Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers, 

With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter, 

That's what I sit up in the dark to say 

225 



To no one any more since Toffile died. 

Let them stay in the attic since they went there. 

I promised Toffile to be cruel to them 

For helping them be cruel once to him. 

SON. We think they had a grave down in the cellar. 

MOTHER. We know they had a grave down in the 
cellar. 

SON. We never could find out whose bones they 
were. 

MOTHER. Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for 

once 

They were a man's his father killed for me. 
I mean a man he killed instead of me. 
The least I could do was to help dig their grave. 
We were about it one night in the cellar. 
Son knows the story: but 'twas not for him 
To tell the truth, suppose the time had come. 
Son looks surprised to see me end a lie 
We'd kept all these years between ourselves 
So as to have it ready for outsiders. 
But tonight I don't care enough to lie 
I don't remember why I ever cared. 
Toffile, if he were here, I don't believe 
Could tell you why he ever cared himself. . . 



226 



She hadn't found the finger-bone she wanted 
Among the buttons poured out in her lap. 
I verified the name next morning: Toffile. 
The rural letter-box said Toffile Lajway. 



227 



AN EMPTY THREAT 

I stay; 

But it isn't as if 

There wasn't always Hudson's Bay 

And the fur trade, 

A small skiff 

And a paddle blade. 

I can just see my tent pegged, 

And me on the floor, 

Crosslegged, 

And a trapper looking in at the door 

With furs to sell. 

His name's Joe, 

Alias John, 

And between what he doesn't know 

And won't tell 

About where Henry Hudson's gone, 

I can't say he's much help; 

But we get on. 

The seal yelp 

On an ice cake. 

It's not men by some mistake? 

No, 

There's not a soul 

128 



l<or a wind- break 

Between me and the North Pole 

Except always John- Joe, 
My French Indian Esquimaux. 
And he's off setting traps, 
In one himself perhaps. 

Give a head shake 

Over so much bay 

Thrown away 

In snow and mist 

That doesn't exist, 

I was going to say, 

For God, man or beast's sake. 

Yet does perhaps for all three. 

Don't ask Joe 

What it is to him. 

It's sometimes dim 

\Vhat it is to me, 

Unless it be 

It's the old captain's dark fate 

Who failed to find or force a strait 

In its two-thousand-mile coast; 

And his crew left him where he failed, 

And nothing came of all he sailed. 

It's to say, 'You and F 
To such a ghost, 



229 



''You and I 

Off here 

With the dead race of the Greak Auk!' 

And, 'Better defeat almost, 

If seen clear, 

Than life's victories of doubt 

That need endless talk talk 

To make them out.' 



230 



FRAGMENTARY BLUE 

Why make so much of fragmentary blue 
In here and there a bird, or butterfly, 
Or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye, 
When heaven presents in sheets the solid hue? 

Since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet) 
Though some savants make earth include the sky; 
And blue so far above us comes so high, 
It only gives our wish for blue a whet. 



231 



FIRE AND ICE 



say the world "will end in fire, 
Some say in ice. 
From what I've tasted of desire 
I hold with those who favor fire. 
But if it had to perish twice, 
I think I know enough of hate 
To say that for destruction ice 
fs also great 
And would suffice. 



232 



DUST OF SNOW 

Ihe way a crow 
Shook down on me 
The dust of snow 
From a hemlock tree 

Has given my heart 
A change of mood 
And saved some part 
Of a day I had rued. 



233 



TO E. T. 

1 slumbered with your poems on my breast 
Spread open as I dropped them half-read through 
Like dove wings on a figure on a tomb 
To see, if in a dream they brought of you, 

I might not have the chance I missed in life 
Through some delay, and call you to your face 
First soldier, and then poet, and then both, 
Who died a soldier-poet of your race. 

1 meant, you meant, that nothing should remain 
Unsaid between us, brother, and this remained 
And one thing more that was not then to say: 
The Victory for what it lost and gained. 

You went to meet the shell's embrace of fire 
On Vimy Ridge; and when you fell that day 
The war seemed over more for you than me, 
But now for me than youthe other way. 

How over, though, for even me who knew 

The foe thrust back unsafe beyond the Rhine, 

If I was not to speak of it to you 

And see you pleased once more with words of mine? 



234 



NOTHING GOLD CAN STAY 

INature's first green is gold, 
Her hardest hue to hold. 
Her early leaf's a flower; 
But only so an hour. 
Then leaf subsides to leaf. 
So Eden sank to grief, 
So dawn goes down to day. 
Nothing gold can stay. 



235 



THE RUNAWAY 

Once when the snow of the year was beginning to 

fall, 
We stopped by a mountain pasture to say, ' Whose 

colt?' 

A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall, 
The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head 
And snorted at us. And then he had to bolt. 
We heard the miniature thunder where he fled, 
And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and 



Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes. 
*I think the little fellow's afraid of the snow. 
He isn't winter-broken. It isn't play 
With the little fellow at all. He's running away. 
I doubt if even his mother could tell him, "Sakes, 
It's only weather/' He'd think she didn't know! 
Where is his mother? He can't be out alone.' 
And now he comes again with clatter of stone, 
And mounts the wall again with whited eyes 
And all his tail that isn't hair up straight. 
He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies. 
'Whoever it is that leaves him out so late, 
When other creatures have gone to stall and bin, 
Ought to be told to come and take him in.' 



236 



THE AIM WAS SONG 

13efore man came to blow it right 

The wind once blew itself untaught, 

And did its loudest day and night 
In any rough place where it caught. 

Man came to tell it what was wrong: 
It hadn't fouijd the place to blow; 

It blew too hardthe aim was song. 
And listen how it ought to go! 

He took a little in his mouth, 

And held it long enough for north 

To be converted into south, 

And then by measure blew it forth. 

By measure. It was word and note, 
The wind the wind had meant to be 
A little through the lips and throat. 
The aim was song the wind could see. 



237 



STOPPING BY WOODS ON A SNOWY 

EVENING 

Whose woods these are I think I know 
His house is in the village though; 
He will not see me stopping here 
To watch his woods fill up with snow. 

My little horse must think it queer 
To stop without a farmhouse near 
Between the woods and frozen lake 
The darkest evening of the year. 

He gives his harness bells a shake 
To ask if there is some mistake. 
The only other sound's the sweep 
Of easy wind and downy flake. 

The woods are lovely, dark and deep. 
But I have promises to keep, 
And miles to go before I sleep, 
And miles to go before I sleep. 



238 



FOR ONCE, THEN, SOMETHING 

vJthers taunt me with having knelt at well-curbs 
Always wrong to the light, so never seeing 
Deeper down in the well than where the water 
Gives me back in a shining surface picture 
Me myself in the summer heaven godlike 
Looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs. 
Once, when trying with chin against a well-curb, 
I discerned, as I thought, beyond the picture, 
Through the picture, a something white, uncertain, 
Something more of the depths and then I lost it. 
Water came to rebuke the too clear water. 
One drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple 
Shook whatever it was lay there at bottom, 
Blurred it, blotted it out. What was that whiteness? 
Truth? A pebble of quartz? For once, then, some- 
thing. 



239 



6LUE-BUTTERFLY DAY 

It is blue-butterfly day here in spring. 

And with these sky-flakes down in flurry on flurry 

There is more unmixed color on the wing 

Than flowers will show for days unless they hurry. 

But these are flowers that fly and all but sing: 
And now from having ridden out desire 
They lie closed over in the wind and cling 
Where wheels have freshly sliced the April mire. 



240 



THE ONSET 

Always the same, when on a fated night 
At last the gathered snow lets down as white 
As may be in dark woods, and with a song 
It shall not make again all winter long 
Of hissing on the yet uncovered ground, 
I almost stumble looking up and round, 
As one who overtaken by the end 
Gives up his errand, and lets death descend 
Upon him where he is, with nothing done 
To evil, no important triumph won, 
More than if life had never been begun. 

Yet all the precedent is on my side: 

I know that winter death has never tried 

The earth but it has failed: the snow may heap 

In long storms an undrifted four feet deep 

As measured against maple, birch and oak, 

It cannot check the peeper's silver croak; 

And I shall see the snow all go down hill 

In water of a slender April rill 

That flashes tail through last year's withered brake 

And dead weeds, like a disappearing snake. 

Nothing will be left white but here a birch, 

And there a clump of houses with a church. 



241 



TO EARTHWARD 

Love at the lips was touch 
As sweet as I could bear; 
And once that seemed too much; 
I lived on air 

That crossed me from sweet things, 
The flow of was it musk 
From hidden grapevine springs 
Down hill at dusk? 

I had the swirl and ache 
From sprays of honeysuckle 
That when they're gathered shake 
Dew on the knuckle. 

I craved strong sweets, but those 
Seemed strong when I was young; 
The petal of the rose 
It was that stung. 

Now no joy but lacks salt 
That is not dashed with pain 
And weariness and fault; 
I crave the stain 

Of tears, the aftermark 
Of almost too much love, 

242 



The sweet of bitter bark 
And burning clove. 

When stiff and sore and scarred 
I take away my hand 
From leaning on it hard 
In grass and sand ; 

The hurt is not enough: 
I long for weight and strength 
To feel the earth as rough 
To all my length. 



GOOD-BYE AND KEEP COLD 

JThis saying good-bye on the edge of the dark 
And the cold to an orchard so young in the bark 
Reminds me of all that can happen to harm 
An orchard away at the end of the farm 
All winter, cut off by a hill from the house. 
[ don't want it girdled by rabbit and mouse, 
[ don't want it dreamily nibbled for browse 
By deer, and I don't want it budded by grouse. 
(If certain it wouldn't be idle to call 
I'd summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall 
And warn them away with a stick for a gun.) 
I don't want it stirred by the heat of the sun, 
(We made it secure against being, I hope^ 
By setting it out on a northerly slope.) 
No orchard's the worse for the wintriest storm; 
But one thing about it ; it mustn't get warm. 
'How often already you've had to be told, 
Keep cold, young orchard. Good-bye and keep cold, 
Dread fifty above more than fifty below.' 
I have to be gone for a season or so. 
My business a while is with different trees, 
Less carefully nurtured, less fruitful than these, 
And such as is done to their wood with an axe-- 
Maples and birches and tamaracks. 
I wish I could promise to lie in the night 
And think of an orchard's arboreal plight 

244 



When slowly (and nobody comes with a light) 
Its heart sinks lower under the sod. 
But something has to be left to God. 



245 



TWO LOOK AT TWO 

JLove and forgetting might have carried them 

A little further up the mountain side 

With night so near, but not much further up. 

They must have halted soon in any case 

With thoughts of the path back, how rough it was 

With rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness; 

When they were halted by a tumbled wall 

With barbed-wire binding. They stood facing this,, 

Spending what onward impulse they still had 

In one last look the way they must not go, 

On up the failing path, where, if a stone 

Or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself; 

No footstep moved it. 'This is all/ they sighed, 

'Good-night to woods.' But not so; there was more. 

A doe from round a spruce stood looking at them 

Across the wall, as near the wall as they. 

She saw them in their field, they her in hers. 

The difficulty of seeing what stood still, 

Like some up-ended boulder split in two, 

Was in her clouded eyes: they saw no fear there. 

She seemed to think that two thus they were safe. 

Then, as if they were something that, though strange, 

She could not trouble her mind with too long, 

She sighed and passed unscared along the wall. 

'This, then, is all. What more is there to ask?' 

But no, not yet. A snort to bid them wait. 

A buck from round the spruce stood looking at them 

246 



Across the wall as near the wall as they. 

This was an antlered buck of lusty nostril, 

Not the same doe come back into her place. 

He viewed them quizzically with jerks of head, 

As if to ask, 'Why don't you make some motion? 

Or give some sign of life? Because you can't. 

I doubt if you're as living as you look/ 

Thus till he had them almost feeling dared 

To stretch a proffering hand and a spell-breaking. 

Then he too passed unscared along the wall. 

Two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from. 

'This must be all/ It was all. Still they stood, 

A great wave from it going over them, 

As if the earth in one unlooked-for favor 

Had made them certain earth returned their love. 



247 



NOT TO KEEP 

Ihey sent him back to her. The letter came 
Saying . . . And she could have him. And before 
She could be sure there was no hidden ill 
Under the formal writing^ he was in her sight, 
Living. They gave him back to her alive- 
How else? They are not known to send the dead- 
And not disfigured visibly. His face? 
His hands? She had to look, to ask, 
' What is it, dear?' And she had given all 
And still she had all they had they the lucky! 
Wasn't she glad now? Everything seemed won, 
And all the rest for them permissible ease. 
She had to ask, ' What was it, dear?' 

* Enough, 

Yet not enough. A bullet through and through, 
High in the breast. Nothing but what good care 
And medicine and rest, and you a week, 
Can cure me of to go again. 7 The same 
Grim giving to do over for them both. 
She dared no more than ask him with her eyes 
How was it with him for a second trial. 
And with his eyes he asked her not to ask. 
They had given him back to her, but not to keep. 



A BROOK IN THE CITY 

Ihe farm house lingers, though averse to square 
With the new city street it has to wear 
A number in. But what about the brook 
That held the house as in an elbow-crook? 
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength 
And impulse, having dipped a finger length 
And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed 
A flower to try its currents where they crossed. 
The meadow grass could be cemented down 
From growing under pavements of a town; 
The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame. 
Is water wood to serve a brook the same? 
How else dispose of an immortal force 
No longer needed? Staunch it at its source 
With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was 

thrown 

Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone 
In fetid darkness still to live and run 
And all fo^ nothing it had ever done 
Except forget to go in fear perhaps. 
No one would know except for ancient maps 
That such a brook ran water. But I wonder 
If from its being kept forever under 
The thoughts may not have risen that so keep 
This new-built city from both work and sleep. 



249 



THE KITCHEN CHIMNEY 

Builder, in building the little house, 
In every way you may please yourself; 
But please please me in the kitchen chimney: 
Don't build me a chimney upon a shelf. 

However far you must go for bricks, 
Whatever they cost a-piece or a pound, 
Buy me enough for a full-length chimney, 

build the chimney clear from the ground. 



It's not that Fm greatly afraid of fire, 
But I never heard of a house that throve 
(And I know of one that didn't thrive) 
Where the chimney started above the stove. 

And I dread the ominous stain of tar 

That there always is on the papered walls, 

And the smell of fire drowned in rain 

That there always is when the chimney's false. 

A shelf's for a clock or vase or picture, 
But I don't see why it should have to bear 
A chimney that only would serve to remind me 
Of castles I used to build in air. 



250 



LOOKING FOR A SUNSET BIRD IN 
WINTER 

Ihe west was getting out of gold, 
The breath of air had died of cold, 
When shoeing home across the white, 
I thought I saw a bird alight. 

In summer when I passed the place 
I had to stop and lift my face; 
A bird with an angelic gift 
Was singing in it sweet and swift. 

No bird was singing in it now. 
A single leaf was on a bough, 
And that was all there was to see 
In going twice around the tree. 

From my advantage on a hill 
I judged that such a crystal chill 
Was only adding frost to snow 
As gilt to gold that wouldn't show. 

A brush had left a crooked stroke 
Of what was either cloud or smoke 
From north to south across the blue; 
A piercing little star was through. 



251 



GATHERING LEAVES 

opades take up leaves 
No better than spoons, 
And bags full of leaves 
Are light as balloons. 

I make a great noise 
Of rustling all day 
Like rabbit and deer 
Running away. 

But the mountains I raise 
Elude my embrace. 
Flowing over my arms 
And into my face. 

I may load and unload 
Again and again 
Till I fill the whole shed, 
And what have I then? 

Next to nothing for weight; 
And since they grew duller 
From contact with earth, 
Next to nothing for color. 



252 



Next to nothing for use. 
But a crop is a crop, 
And who's to say where 
The harvest shall stop? 



253 



MISGIVING 

All crying 'We will go with you, O Wind!' 
The foliage follow him, leaf and stem; 
But a sleep oppresses them as they go, 
And they end by bidding him stay with them. 

Since ever they flung abroad in spring 
The leaves had promised themselves this flight, 
Who now would fain seek sheltering wall, 
Or thicket, or hollow place for the night. 

And now they answer his summoning blast 

With an ever vaguer and vaguer stir, 

Or at utmost a little reluctant whirl 

That drops them no further than where they were 

I only hope that when I am free 

As they are free to go in quest 

Of the knowledge beyond the bounds of life 

It may not seem better to me to rest. 



254 



PLOWMEN 

A plow, they say., to plow the snow. 
They cannot mean to plant it, though- 
Unless in bitterness to mock 
At having cultivated rock. 



255 



ON A TREE FALLEN ACROSS THE 
ROAD 

(TO HEAR US TALK) 

I he tree the tempest with a crash of wood 
Throws down in front of us is not to bar 
Our passage to our journey's end for good, 
But just to ask us who we think we are 

Insisting always on our own way so. 
She likes to halt us in our runner tracks, 
And make us get down in a foot of snow 
Debating what to do without an axe. 

And yet she knows obstruction is in vain: 

We will not be put off the final goal 

We have it hidden in us to attain, 

Not though we have to seize earth by the pole 

And, tired of aimless circling in one place, 
Steer straight off after something into space. 



256 



OUR SINGING STRENGTH 

It snowed in spring on earth so dry and warm 
The flakes could find no landing place to form. 
Hordes spent themselves to make it wet and cold, 
And still they failed of any lasting hold. 
They made no white impression on the black. 
They disappeared as if earth sent them back. 
Not till from separate flakes they changed at night 
To almost strips and tapes of ragged white 
Did grass and garden ground confess it snowed. 
And all go back to winter but the road. 
Next day the scene was piled and puffed and dead. 
The grass lay flattened under one great tread. 
Borne down until the end almost took root, 
The rangey bough anticipated fruit 
With snowballs cupped in every opening bud. 
The road alone maintained itself in mud, 
Whatever its secret was of greater heat 
From inward fires or brush of passing feet. 

In spring more mortal singers than belong 

To any one place cover us with song. 

Thrush, bluebird, blackbird, sparrow, and robin 

throng; 

Some to go further north to Hudson's Bay, 
Some that have come too far north back away, 
Really a very few to build and stay. 
Now was seen how these liked belated snow. 



The fields had nowhere left for them to go; 

They'd soon exhausted all there was in flying; 

The trees they'd had enough of with once trying 

And setting off their heavy powder load. 

They could find nothing open but the road. 

So there they let their lives be narrowed in 

By thousands the bad weather made akin. 

The road became a channel running flocks 

Of glossy birds like ripples over rocks. 

[ drove them under foot in bits of flight 

That kept the ground, almost disputing right 

Of way with me from apathy of wing, 

A talking twitter all they had to sing. 

A few I must have driven to despair 

Made quick asides, but having done in air 

A whir among white branches great and small 

As in some too much carven marble hall 

Where one false wing beat would have brought 

down all, 

Came tamely back in front of me, the Drover, 
To suffer the same driven nightmare over. 
One such storm in a lifetime couldn't teach them 
That back behind pursuit it couldn't reach them; 
None flew behind me to be left alone. 

Well, something for a snowstorm to have shown 
The country' s singing strength thus brought together, 
That though repressed and moody with the weather 
Was none the less there ready to be freed 
And sing the wildflowers up from root and seed. 

253 



THE NEED OF BEING VERSED IN 
COUNTRY THINGS 

Ihe house had gone to bring again 
To the midnight sky a sunset glow. 
Now the chimney was all of the house that stood, 
Like a pistil after the petals go. 

The barn opposed across the way, 
That would have joined the house in flame 
Had it been the will of the wind, was left 
To bear forsaken the place's name. 

No more it opened with all one end 
For teams that came by the stony road 
To drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs 
And brush the mow with the summer load. 

The birds that came to it through the air 
At broken windows flew out and in, 
Their murmur more like the sigh we sigh 
From too much dwelling on what has been. 

Yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf, 
And the aged elm, though touched with fire; 
And the dry pump flung up an awkward arm; 
And the fence post carried a strand of wire. 



259 



For them there was really nothing sad. 
But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept, 
One had to be versed in country things 
Not to believe the phoebes wept 



26O 



West-Running Brook 



SPRING POOLS 

Ihese pools that, though in forests, still reflect 
The total sky almost without defect, 
And like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver, 
Will like the flowers beside them soon be gone, 
And yet not out by any brook or river, 
But up by roots to bring dark foliage on. 

The trees that have it in their pent-up buds 
To darken nature and be summer woods- 
Let them think twice before they use their powers 
To blot out and drink up and sweep away 
These flowery waters and these watery flowers 
From snow that melted only yesterday. 



263 



THE FREEDOM OF THE MOON 

I ve tried the new moon tilted in the air 
Above a hazy tree-and-farmhouse cluster 
As you might try a jewel in your hair, 
I've tried it fine with little breadth of lustre, 
Alone, or in one ornament combining 
With one first-water star almost as shining. 

I put it shining anywhere I please. 
By walking slowly on some evening later, 
I've pulled it from a crate of crooked trees, 
And brought it over glossy water, greater, 
And dropped it in, and seen the image wallow, 
The color run, all sorts of wonder follow. 



264 



FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN 

ilere come real stars to fill the upper skies, 
And here on earth come emulating flies, 
That though they never equal stars in size, 
(And they were never really stars at heart) 
Achieve at times a very star-like start. 
Only, of course, they can't sustain the part. 



365 



ATMOSPHERE 

INSCRIPTION FOR A GARDEN WALL 

XVinds blow the open grassy places bleak; 
But where this old wall burns a sunny cheek, 
They eddy over it too toppling weak 
To blow the earth or anything self-clear; 
Moisture and color and odor thicken here. 
The hours of daylight gather atmosphere. 



266 



DEVOTION 

Ihe heart can think of no devotion 
Greater than being shore to the ocean- 
Holding the curve of one position, 
Counting an endless repetition. 



267 



ON GOING UNNOTICED 

As vain to raise a voice as a sigh 
In the tumult of free leaves on high. 
What are you in the shadow of trees 
Engaged up there with the light and breeze? 

Less than the coral-root you know 
That is content with the daylight low, 
And has no leaves at all of its own; 
Whose spotted flowers hang meanly down 

You grasp the bark by a rugged pleat. 
And look up small from the forest's feet. 
The only leaf it drops goes wide. 
Your name not written on either side. 

You linger your little hour and are gone, 
And still the woods sweep leafily on, 
Not even missing the coral-root flower 
You took as a trophy of the hour. 



268 



A PASSING GLIMPSE 

To Ridgely Torrence 

On Last Looking Into His 'Hesperides* 



1 often see flowers from a passing car 

That are gone before I can tell what they are. 

I want to get out of the train and go back 
To see what they were beside the track. 

I name all the flowers I am sure they weren't: 
Not fireweed loving where woods have burnt- 

Not blue bells gracing a tunnel mouth- 
Not lupine living on sand and drouth. 

Was something brushed across my mind 
That no one on earth will ever find? 

Heaven gives its glimpses only to those 
Not in position to look too close. 



369 



A PECK OF GOLD 

Dust always blowing about the town, 
Except when sea-fog laid it down, 
And I was one of the children told 
Some of the blowing dust was gold. 

All the dust the wind blew high 
Appeared like gold in the sunset sky, 
But I was one of the children told 
Some of the dust was really gold. 

Such was life in the Golden Gate: 
Gold dusted all we drank and ate, 
And I was one of the children told, 
'We all must eat our peck of gold/ 



270 



ACCEPTANCE 

When the spent sun throws up its rays on cloud 
And goes down burning into the gulf below, 
No voice in nature is heard to cry aloud 
At what has happened. Birds, at least, must know 
It is the change to darkness in the sky. 
Murmuring something quiet in her breast, 
One bird begins to close a faded eye; 
Or overtaken too far from his nest, 
Hurrying low above the grove, some waif 
Swoops just in time to his remembered tree. 
At most he thinks or twitters softly, 'Safe! 
Now let the night be dark for all of me. 
Let the night be too dark for me to see 
Into the future. Let what will be, be/ 



271 



ONCE BY THE PACIFIC 

Ihe shattered water made a misty din. 
Great waves looked over others coming in, 
And thought of doing something to the shore 
That water never did to land before. 
The clouds were low and hairy in the skies, 
Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes. 
You could not tell, and yet it looked as if 
The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff, 
The cliff in being backed by continent; 
It looked as if a night of dark intent 
Was coming, and not only a night, an age. 
Someone had better be prepared for rage. 
There would be more than ocean-water broken 
Before God's last Put out the Light was spoken. 



272 



LODGED 

Ihe rain to the wind said 
1 You push and I'll pelt/ 
They so smote the garden bed 
That the flowers actually knelt, 
And lay lodged though not dead. 
I know how the flowers felt.

A MINOR BIRD 

I have wished a bird would fly away, 
And not sing by my house all day; 

Have clapped my hands at him from the door 
When it seemed as if I could bear no more. 

The fault must partly have been in me. 
The bird was not to blame for his key. 

And of course there must be something wrong 
In wanting to silence any song. 



274 



BEREFT 

Where had I heard this wind before 
Change like this to a deeper roar? 
WTiat would it take my standing there for, 
Holding open a restive door, 
Looking down hill to a frothy shore? 
Summer was past and day was past. 
Sombre clouds in the west were massed. 
Out in the porch's sagging floor, 
Leaves got up in a coil and hissed, 
Blindly struck at my knee and missed. 
Something^sinister in the tone 
Told me my secret must be known: 
\Vord I was in the house alone 
Somehow must have gotten abroad, 
"Word I was in my life alone, 
Word I had no one left but God, 



275 



TREE AT MY WINDOW 

Iree at my window, window tree, 
My sash is lowered when night comes on; 
3ut let there never be curtain drawn 
Between you and me. 

Vague dream-head lifted out of the ground, 
And thing next most diffuse to cloud, 
Not all your light tongues talking aloud 
Could be profound. 

But tree, I have seen you taken and tossed, 
And if you have seen me when I slept, 
You have seen me when I was taken and swept 
And all but lost. 

That day she put our heads together, 
Fate had her imagination about her, 
Your head so much concerned with outer, 
Mine with inner, weather. 



276 



THE PEACEFUL SHEPHERD 

If heaven were to do again, 
And on the pasture bars, 
I leaned to line the figures in 
Between the dotted stars, 

I should be tempted to forget, 

I fear, the Crown of Rule, 

The Scales of Trade, the Cross of Faith, 

As hardly worth renewal. 

For these have governed in our lives, 
And see how men have warred. 
The Cross, the Crown, the Scales may all 
As well have been the Sword. 



277 



A WINTER EDEN 

A winter garden in an alder swamp, 

Where conies now come out to sun and romp, 

As near a paradise as it can be 

And not melt snow or start a dormant tree. 

It lifts existence on a plane of snow 
One level higher than the earth below, 
One level nearer heaven overhead, 
And last year's berries shining scarlet red. 

It lifts a gaunt luxuriating beast 
Where he can stretch and hold his highest feast 
On some wild apple tree's young tender bark, 
What well may prove the year's high girdle mark. 

So near to paradise all pairing ends: 
Here loveless birds now flock as winter friends, 
Content with bud-inspecting. They presume 
To say which buds are leaf and which are bloom. 

A feather-hammer gives a double knock. 
This Eden day is done at two o'clock. 
An hour of winter day might seem too short 
To make it worth life's while to wake and sport. 



278 



THE FLOOD 

Blood has been harder to dam back than water. 

Just when we think we have it impounded safe 

Behind new barrier walls (and let it chafe!), 

It breaks away in some new kind of slaughter. 

We choose to say it is let loose by the devil; 

But power of blood itself releases blood. 

It goes by might of being such a flood 

Held high at so unnatural a level. 

It will have outlet, brave and not so brave. 

Weapons of war and implements of peace 

Are but the points at which it finds release. 

And now it is once more the tidal wave 

That when it has swept by leaves summits stained. 

Oh, blood will out. It cannot be contained. 



ACQUAINTED WITH THE NIGHT 

1 have been one acquainted with the night. 
I have "walked out in rain and back in rain. 
I have outwalked the furthest city light. 

I have looked down the saddest city lane. 
I have passed by the watchman on his beat 
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain. 

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet 
When far away an interrupted cry 
Came over houses from another sireet, 

But not to call me back or say good-bye; 
And further still at an unearthly height, 
One luminary clock against the sky 

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right 
I have been one acquainted with the night. 



280 



THE LOVELY SHALL BE CHOOSERS 

The Voice said, <Hther<JoM*i!' 
The Voices, c How far down?' 
'Seven levels of the world/ 
'How much time have we?' 

'Take twenty years. 

She would refuse love safe with wealth and honor! 

The lovely shall be choosers, shall they? 

Then let them choose!' 

'Then we shall let her choose?' 

'Yes, let her choose. 

Take up the task beyond her choosing.' 

Invisible hands crowded on her shoulder 

In readiness to weigh upon her. 

But she stood straight still, 

In broad round ear-rings, gold and jet with pearls 

And broad round suchlike brooch, 

Her cheeks high colored, 

Proud and the pride of friends. 

The Voice asked, 'You can let her choose?* 

281 



'Yes, we can let her and still triumph/ 

'Do it by joys, and leave her always blameless. 

Be her first joy her wedding, 

That though a wedding, 

Is yet well something they know, he and she. 

And after that her next joy 

That though she grieves,, her grief is secret: 

Those friends know nothing of her grief to make it 

shameful 
Her third joy that though now they cannot help but 

know, 

They move in pleasure too far off 
To think much or much care. 
Give her a child at either knee for fourth joy 
To tell once and once only, for them never to forget, 
How once she walked in brightness, 
And make them see it in the winter firelight. 
But give her friends for then she dare not tell 
For their foregone incredulousness 
And be her next joy this: 
Her never having deigned to tell them. 
Make her among the humblest even 
Seem to them less than they are. 
Hopeless of being known for what she has been, 
Failing of being loved for what she is, 
Give her the comfort for her sixth of knowing 
She fails from strangeness to a way of life 
She came to from too high too late to learn. 
Then send some one with eyes to see 

282 



CANIS MAJOR 

Ihe great Overdog, 
That heavenly beast 
With a star in one eye, 
Gives a leap in the east. 

He dances upright 
All the way to the west 
And never once drops 
On his forefeet to rest. 

I'm a poor underdog, 
But tonight I will bark 
With the great Overdog 
That romps through the dark. 



289 



A SOLDIER 

Jrle is that fallen lance that lies as hurled, 
That lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust, 
But still lies pointed as it plowed the dust. 
If we who sight along it round the world, 
See nothing worthy to have been its mark, 
It is because like men we look too near, 
Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere, 
Our missiles always make too short an arc. 
They fall, they rip the grass, they intersect 
The curve of earth, and striking, break their own; 
They make us cringe for metal-point on stone. 
But this we know, the obstacle that checked 
And tripped the body, shot the spirit on 
Further than target ever showed or shone. 



IMMIGRANTS 



IN o ship of all that under sailor or steam 
Have gathered people to us more and more 
But Pilgrim-manned the Mayflower in a dream 
Has been her anxious convey in to shore. 



291 



HANNIBAL 



Was there ever a cause too lost, 

Ever a cause that was lost too long, 

Or that showed with the lapse of time too vain 

For the generous tears of youth and song?

THE FLOWER BOAT 

The fisherman's swapping a yarn for a yarn 
Under the hand of the village barber, 
And here in the angle of house and barn 
His deep-sea dory has found a harbor. 

At anchor she rides the sunny sod 

As full to the gunnel of flowers growing 

As ever she turned her home with cod 

From George's bank when winds were blowing. 

And I judge from that Elysian freight 
That all they ask is rougher weather, 
And dory and master will sail by fate 
To seek for the Happy Isles together. 



THE TIMES TABLE 

JVlore than half way up the pass 

Was a spring with a broken drinking glass, 

And whether the farmer drank or not 

His mare was sure to observe the spot 

By cramping the wheel on a water-bar, 

Turning her forehead with a star, 

And straining her ribs for a monster sigh; 

To which the farmer would make reply, 

1 A sigh for every so many breath, 

And for every so many sigh a death. 

That's what I always tell my wife 

Is the multiplication table of life.' 

The saying may be ever so true; 

But it's just the kind of a thing that you, 

Nor I, nor nobody else may say, 

Unless our purpose is doing harm, 

And then I know of no better way 

To close a road, abandon a farm, 

Reduce the births of the human race, 

And bring back nature in people's place. 



294 



THE INVESTMENT ^ 

Over back where they speak of life as staying 
('You couldn't call it living, for it ain't'), 
There was an old, old house renewed with paint, 
And in it a piano loudly playing. 

Out in the ploughed ground in the cold a digger, 
Among unearthed potatoes standing still, 
Was counting winter dinners, one a hill, 
With half an ear to the piano's vigor. 

All that piano and new paint back there, 
Was it some money suddenly come into? 
Or some extravagance young love had been to? 
Or old love on an impulse not to care- 
Not to sink under being man and wife, 
But get some color and music out of life? 



295 



THE LAST MOWING 

There's a place called Far-away Meadow 

We never shall mow in again, 

Or such is the talk at the farmhouse: 

The meadow is finished with men. 

Then now is the chance for the flowers 

That can't stand mowers and plowers. 

It must be now, though, in season 

Before the not mowing brings trees on, 

Before trees, seeing the opening, 

March into a shadowy claim. 

The trees are all I'm afraid of, 

That flowers can't bloom in the shade of; 

It's no more men I'm afraid of; 

The meadow is done with the tame. 

The place for the moment is ours 

For you, oh tumultuous flowers, 

To go to waste and go wild in, 

All shapes and colors of flowers, 

I needn't call you by name. 



296 



THE BIRTHPLACE 

ilere further up the mountain slope 
Than there was ever any hope, 
My father built, enclosed a spring, 
Strung chains of Avail round everything, 
Subdued the growth of earth to grass, 
And brought our various lives to pass. 
A dozen girls and boys we were. 
The mountain seemed to like the stir, 
And made of us a little while 
With always something in her smile. 
Today she wouldn't know our name. 
(No girl's, of course, has stayed the same.) 
The mountain pushed us off her knees. 
And now her lap is full of trees. 



297 



DUST IN THE EYES 

If, as they say, some dust thrown in my eyes 
Will keep my talk from getting overwise, 
I'm not the one for putting off the proof. 
Let it be overwhelming, off a roof 
And round a corner, blizzard snow for dust 
And blind me to a standstill if it must. 



298 



SITTING BY A BUSH IN BROAD 
SUNLIGHT 

\A/hen I spread out my hand here today, 
I catch no more than a ray 
To feel of between thumb and fingers; 
No lasting effect of it lingers. 

There was one time and only the one 
When dust really took in the sun; 
And from that one intake of fire 
All creatures still warmly suspire. 

And if men have watched a long time 
And never seen sun-smitten slime 
Again come to life and crawl off, 
We must not be too ready to scoff. 

God once declared he was true 
And then took the veil and withdrew, 
And remember how final a hush 
Then descended of old on the bush. 

God once spoke to people by name. 
The sun once imparted its flame 
One impulse persists as our breath; 
The other persists as our faith. 



299 



WHAT FIFTY SAID 

\Vhen I was young my teachers were the old. 

I gave up fire for form till I was cold. 

I suffered like a metal being cast. 

I went to school to age to learn the past. 

Now I am old my teachers are the young. 

What can't be moulded must be cracked and sprung, 

I strain at lessons fit to start a suture. 

I go to school to youth to learn the future.

RIDERS 

The surest thing there is is we are riders, 
And though none too successful at it, guiders, 
Through everything presented, land and tide 
And now the very air, of what we ride. 

WTiat is this talked-of mystery of birth 
But being mounted bareback on the earth? 
We can just see the infant up astride, 
His small fist buried in the bushy hide. 

There is our wildest mount a headless horse. 
But though it runs unbridled off its course, 
And all our blandishments would seem defied, 
We have ideas yet that we haven't tried. 



301 



ON LOOKING UP BY CHANCE AT 
THE CONSTELLATIONS 

You'll wait a long, long time for anything much 
To happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud 
And the Northern Lights that run like tingling 

nerves. 
The sun and moon get crossed, but they never 

touch, 
Nor strike out fire from each other, nor crash oul 

loud. 

The planets seem to interfere in their curves, 
But nothing ever happens, no harm is done. 
We may as well go patiently on with our life, 
And look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun 
For the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane. 
It is true the longest drouth will end in rain, 
The longest peace in China will end in strife. 
Still it wouldn't reward the watcher to stay awake 
In hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break 
On his particular time and personal sight. 
That calm seems certainly safe to last tonight.

THE BEAR 

1 he bear puts both arms around the tree above her 
And draws it down as if it were a lover 
And its choke cherries lips to kiss good-bye, 
Then lets it snap back upright in the sky. 
Her next step rocks a boulder on the wall 
(She's making her cross-country in the fall). 
Her great weight creaks the barbed- wire in its staples 
As she flings over and off down through the maples, 
Leaving on one wire tooth a lock of hair. 
Such is the uncaged progress of the bear. 
The world has room to make a bear feel free; 
The universe seems cramped to you and me. 
Man acts more like the poor bear in a cage 
That all day fights a nervous inward rage, 
His mood rejecting all his mind suggests. 
He paces back and forth and never rests 
The toe-nail click and shuffle of his feet, 
The telescope at one end of his beat, 
And at the other end the microscope, 
Two instruments of nearly equal hope, 
And in conjunction giving quite a spread. 
Or if he rests from scientific tread, 
'Tis only to sit back and sway his head 
Through ninety odd degrees of arc, it seems, 
Between two metaphysical extremes. 
He sits back on his fundamental butt 
With lifted snout and eyes (if any) shut, 

303 



(He almost looks religious but he's not), 

And back and forth he sways from cheek to cheek, 

At one extreme agreeing with one Greek, 

At the other agreeing with another Greek 

Which may be thought, but only so to speak. 

A baggy figure, equally pathetic 

When sedentary and when peripatetic. 



304 



THE EGG AND THE MACHINE 

JTle gave the solid rail a hateful kick. 

From far away there came an answering tick 

And then another tick. He knew the code: 

His hate had roused an engine up the road. 

He wished when he had had the track alone 

He had attacked it with a club or stone 

And bent some rail wide open like a switch 

So as to wreck the engine in the ditch. 

Too late though, now, he had himself to thank. 

Its click was rising to a nearer clank. 

Here it came breasting like a horse in skirts. 

(He stood well back for fear of scalding squirts.) 

Then for a moment all there was was size 

Confusion and a roar that drowned the cries 

He raised against the gods in the machine. 

Then once again the sandbank lay serene. 

The traveler's eye picked up a turtle trail, 

Between the dotted feet a streak of tail, 

And followed it to where he made out vague 

But certain signs of buried turtle's egg; 

And probing with one finger not too rough, 

He found suspicious sand, and sure enough, 

The pocket of a little turtle mine. 

If there was one egg in it there were nine, 

Torpedo-like, with shell of gritty leather 

All packed in sand to wait the trump together. 

'You'd better not disturb me any more,' 

305 



He told the distance, *I am armed for war. 
The next machine that has the power to pass 
Will get this plasm in its goggle glass.' 



A Further Range 



A LONE STRIKER 

1 he swinging mill bell changed its rate 
To tolling like the count of fate, 
And though at that the tardy ran, 
One failed to make the closing gate. 
There was a law of God or man 
That on the one who came too late 
The gate for half an hour be locked. 
His time be lost, his pittance docked. 
He stood rebuked and unemployed. 
The straining mill began to shake. 
The mill, though many, many eyed, 
Had eyes inscrutably opaque; 
So that he couldn't look inside 
To see if some forlorn machine 
Was standing idle for his sake. 
(He couldn't hope its heart would break.) 

And yet he thought he saw the scene: 
The air was full of dust of wool. 
A thousand yarns were under pull, 
But pull so slow, with such a twist, 
All day from spool to lesser spool, 
It seldom overtaxed their strength; 
They safely grew in slender length. 
And if one broke by any chance, 
The spinner saw it at a glance. 
The spinner still was there to spin. 



300 



That's where the human still came in. 
Her deft hand showed with finger rings 
Among the harp-like spread of strings. 
She caught the pieces end to end 
And, with a touch that never missed, 
Not so much tied as made them blend. 
Man's ingenuity was good. 
He saw it plainly where he stood, 
Yet found it easy to resist. 

He knew another place, a wood, 

And in it, tall as trees, were cliffs; 

And if he stood on one of these, 

'Twould be among the tops of trees, 

Their upper branches round him wreathing 

Their breathing mingled with his breathing, 

Ifif he stood! Enough of ifs! 

He knew a path that wanted walking; 

He knew a spring that wanted drinking; 

A thought that wanted further thinking; 

A love that wanted re-renewing. 

Nor was this just a way of talking 

To save him the expense of doing. 

With him it boded action, deed. 

The factory was very fine; 
He wished it all the modern speed. 
Yet, after all, 'twas not divine, 
That is to say, 'twas not a church. 
He never would assume that he'd 

310 



r5e any institution's need. 

But he said then arid still would say 

If there should ever come a day 

\Vhen industry seemed like to die 

Because he left it in the lurch, 

Or even merely seemed to pine 

For want of his appro val, why 

Come get him they knew where to search. 



TWO TRAMPS IN MUD TIME 

Out of the mud two strangers came 

And caught me splitting wood in the yard. 

And one of them put me off my aim 

By hailing cheerily 'Hit them hard!' 

I knew pretty well why he dropped behind 

And let the other go on a way. 

I knew pretty well what he had in mind: 

He wanted to take my job for pay. 

Good blocks of beech it was I split, 
As large around as the chopping block; 
And every piece I squarely hit 
Fell splinterless as a cloven rock. 
The blows that a life of self-control 
Spares to strike for the common good 
That day, giving a loose to my soul, 
I spent on the unimportant wood. 

The sun was warm but the wind was chill. 
You know how it is with an April day 
When the sun is out and the wind is still, 
You're one month on in the middle of May. 
But if you so much as dare to speak, 
A cloud comes over the sunlit arch, 
A wind comes off a frozen peak, 
And you're two months back in the middle of 
March. 

312 



A DRUMLIN WOODCHUCK 

(Jne thing has a shelving bank, 

Another a rotting plank, 

To give it cozier skies 

And make up for its lack of size. 

My own strategic retreat 
Is where two rocks almost meet, 
And still more secure and snug, 
A two-door burrow I dug. 

With those in mind at my back 
I can sit forth exposed to attack 
As one who shrewdly pretends 
That he and the world are friends. 

All we who prefer to live 
Have a little whistle we give, 
And flash, at the least alarm 
We dive down under the farm. 

We allow some time for guile 
And don't come out for a while 
Either to eat or drink. 
We take occasion to think. 

And if after the hunt goes past 
And the double-barrelled blast 



321 



But not long since in the lumber camps). 
They thought all chopping was theirs of right. 
Men of the woods and lumber jacks, 
They judged me by their appropriate tool. 
Except as a fellow handled an ax, 
They had no way of knowing a fool. 

Nothing on either side was said. 

They knew they had but to stay their stay 

And all their logic would fill my head: 

As that I had no right to play 

With what was another man's work for gain. 

My right might be love but theirs was need. 

And where the two exist in twain 

Theirs was the better right agreed. 

But yield who will to their separation, 
My object in living is to unite 
My avocation and my vocation 
As my two eyes make one in sight. 
Only where love and need are one, 
And the work is play for mortal stakes, 
Is the deed ever really done 
For Heaven and the future's sakes. 



THE WHITE-TAILED HORNET 

The white-tailed hornet lives in a balloon 

That floats against the ceiling of the woodshed. 

The exit he comes out at like a bullet 

Is like the pupil of a pointed gun. 

And having power to change his aim in flight, 

He comes out more unerring than a bullet. 

Verse could be written on the certainty 

With which he penetrates my best defense 

Of whirling hands and arms about the head 

To stab me in the sneeze-nerve of a nostril. 

Such is the instinct of it I allow. 

Yet how about the insect certainty 

That in the neighborhood of home and children 

!s such an execrable judge of motives 

As not to recognize in me the exception 

I like to think I am in everything 

One who would never hang above a bookcase 

His Japanese crepe-paper globe for trophy? 

He stung me first and stung me afterward. 

He rolled me off the field head over heels, 

And would not listen to my explanations. 

That's when I went as visitor to his house. 
As visitor at my house he is better. 
Hawking for flies about the kitchen door, 
In at one door perhaps and out another, 
Trust him then not to put you in the wrong. 

315 



He won't misunderstand your freest movements. 

Let him light on your skin unless you mind 

So many prickly grappling feet at once. 

He's after the domesticated fly 

To feed his thumping grubs as big as he is. 

Here he is at his best, but even here- 

I watched him where he swooped, he pounced, he 

struck; 

But what he found he had was just a nailhead. 
He struck a second time. Another nailhead. 
'Those are just nailheads. Those are fastened down/ 
Then disconcerted and not unannoyed, 
He stooped and struck a little huckleberry 
The way a player curls around a football. 
'Wrong shape, wrong color, and wrong scent/ 1 said. 
The huckleberry rolled him on his head. 
At last it was a fly. He shot and missed; 
And the fly circled round him in derision. 
But for the fly he might have made me think 
He had been at his poetry, comparing 
Nailhead with fly and fly with huckleberry: 
How like a fly, how very like a fly. 
But the real fly he missed would never do; 
The missed fly made me dangerously skeptic. 

Won't this whole instinct matter bear revision? 

Won't almost any theory bear revision? 

To err is human, not to, animal. 

Or so we pay the compliment to instinct, 

Only too liberal of our compliment 

316 



That really takes away instead of gives. 

Our worship, humor, conscientiousness 

Went long since to the dogs under the table. 

And served us right for having instituted 

Downward comparisons. As long on earth 

As our comparisons were stoutly upward 

With gods and angels, we were men at least, 

But little lower than the gods and angels. 

But once comparisons were yielded downward, 

Once we began to see our images 

Reflected in the mud and even dust, 

'Twas disillusion upon disillusion. 

We were lost piecemeal to the animals, 

Like people thrown out to delay the wolves. 

Nothing but fallibility was left us, 

And this day ' s work made even that seem doubtful. 



31? 



k BLUE RIBBON AT AMESBURY 

Ouch a fine pullet ought to go 
All coiffured to a winter show, 
And be exhibited, and win. 
The answer is this one has been 

And come with all her honors home. 
Her golden leg, her coral comb, 
Her fluff of plumage, white as chalk, 
Her style, were all the fancy's talk. 

It seems as if you must have heard. 
She scored an almost perfect bird. 
In her we make ourselves acquainted. 
With one a Sewell might have painted. 

Here common with the flock again, 
At home in her abiding pen, 
She lingers feeding at the trough, 
The last to let night drive her off. 

The one who gave her ankle-band, 
Her keeper, empty pail in hand, 
He lingers too, averse to slight 
His chores for all the wintry night. 

He leans against the dusty wall, 
Immured almost beyond recall, 

318 



A depth past many swinging doors 
And many litter-muffled floors. 

He meditates the breeder's art. 
He has a half a mind to start, 
With her for Mother Eve, a race 
That shall all living things displace. 

'Tis ritual with her to lay 
The full six days, then rest a day; 
At which rate barring broodiness 
She well may score an egg-success. 

The gatherer can always tell 

Her well-turned egg's brown sturdy shell, 

As safe a vehicle of seed 

As is vouchsafed to feathered breed, 

No human spectre at the feast 
Can scant or hurry her the least. 
She takes her time to take her fill. 
She whets a sleepy sated bill. 

She gropes across the pen alone 
To peck herself a precious stone. 
She waters at the patient fount. 
And so to roost, the last to mount. 

The roost is her extent of flight. 
Yet once she rises to the height, 



319 



She shoulders with a wing so strong 
She makes the whole flock move along. 

The night is setting in to blow. 
It scours the windowpane with snow, 
But barely gets from them or her 
For comment a complacent chirr. 

The lowly pen is yet a hold 
Against the dark and wind and cold 
To give a prospect to a plan 
And warrant prudence in a man.

I can sit forth exposed to attack 
As one who shrewdly pretends 
That he and the world are friends. 

All we who prefer to live 
Have a little whistle we give, 
And flash, at the least alarm 
We dive down under the farm. 

We allow some time for guile 
And don't come out for a while 
Either to eat or drink. 
We take occasion to think. 

And if after the hunt goes past 
And the double-barrelled blast 



321 



(Like war and pestilence 

And the loss of common sense), 

If I can with confidence say 
That still for another day, 
Or even another year, 
I will be there for you, my dear, 

It will be because, though small 
As measured again the All, 
I have been so instinctively thorough 
About my crevice and burrow.

THE GOLD HESPERIDEE 

Oquare Matthew Male's young grafted appletree 

Began to blossom at the age of five; 

And after having entertained the bee, 

And cast its flowers and all the stems but three, 

It set itself to keep those three alive; 

And downy wax the three began to thrive. 

They had just given themselves a little twist 
And turned from looking up and being kissed 
To looking down and yet not being sad, 
When came Square Hale with Let's see what we had; 
And two was all he counted (one he missed); 
But two for a beginning wasn't bad. 

His little Matthew, also five years old, 
Was led into the presence of the tree 
And raised among the leaves and duly told, 
We mustn't touch them yet, but see and see! 
And what was green would by and by be gold. 
Their name was called the Gold Hesperidee. 

As regularly as he went to feed the pig 
Or milk the cow, he visited the fruit, 
The dew of night and morning on his boot. 
Dearer to him than any barnyard brute, 
Each swung in danger on its slender twig, 
A bubble on a pipe-stem growing big. 

323 



Long since they swung as three instead of two 
One more, he thought, to take him safely through. 
Three made it certain nothing Fate could do 
With codlin moth or rusty parasite 
Would keep him now from proving with a bite 
That the name Gold Hesperidee was right. 

And so he brought them to the verge of frost. 
But one day when the foliage all went swish 
With autumn and the fruit was rudely tossed, 
He thought no special goodness could be lost 
If he fulfilled at last his summer wish, 
And saw them picked unbruised and in a dish, 

Where they could ripen safely to the eating. 

But when he came to look, no apples there 

Under, or on the tree, or anywhere, 

And the light-natured tree seemed not to care! 

'Twas Sunday and Square Hale was dressed for 

meeting, 
The final summons into church was beating. 

Just as he was without an uttered sound 
At those who'd done him such a wrong as that, 
Square Matthew Hale took off his Sunday hat 
And ceremoniously laid it on the ground, 
And leaping on it with a solemn bound, 
Danced slowly on it till he trod it flat. 



324 



Then suddenly he saw the thing he did. 
And looked around to see if he was seen. 
This was the sin that Ahaz was forbid 
(The meaning of the passage had been hid): 
To look upon the tree -when it was green 
And worship apples.What else could it mean? 

God saw him dancing in the orchard path, 
But mercifully kept the passing crowd 
From witnessing the fault of one so proud. 
And so the story wasn't told in Gath; 
In gratitude for which Square Matthew vowed 
To walk a graver man restrained <n wrath. 



325 



IN TIME OF CLOUDBURST 

Let the downpour roil and toil! 
The worst it can do to me 
Is carry some garden soil 
A little nearer the sea. 

J Tis the world-old way of the rain 
When it comes to a mountain farm 
To exact for a present gain 
A little of future harm. 

And the harm is none too sure, 
For when all that was rotted rich 
Shall be in the end scoured poor, 
When my garden has gene down ditch, 

Some force has but to apply, 
And summits shall be immersed, 
The bottom of seas raised dry 
The slope of the earth reversed. 

Then all I need do is run 
To the other end of the slope, 
And on tracts laid new to the sun, 
Begin all over to hope. 

Some worn old tool of my own 
Will be turned up by the plow, 

326 



The wood of it changed to stone, 
But as ready to wield as now. 

May my application so close 
To so endless a repetition 
Not make me tired and morose 
And resentful of man's condition. 



327 



A ROADSIDE STAND 

1 he little old house was out with a little new shed 
In front at the edge of the road where the traffic sped, 
A roadside stand that too pathetically plead, 
It would not be fair to say for a dole of bread, 
But for some of the money, the cash, whose flow 

supports 

The flower of cities from sinking and withering faint. 
The polished traffic passed with a mind ahead, 
Or if ever aside a moment, then out of sorts 
At having the landscape marred with the artless paint 
Of signs that with N turned wrong and S turned 

wrong 

Offered for sale wild berries in wooden quarts, 
Or crook-necked golden squash with silver warts, 
Or beauty rest in a beautiful mountain scene. 
You have the money, but if you want to be mean, 
Why keep your money (this crossly), and go along. 
The hurt to the scenery wouldn't be my complaint 
So much as the trusting sorrow of what is unsaid: 
Here far from the city we make our roadside stand 
And ask for some city money to feel in hand 
To try if it will not make our being expand, 
And give us the life of the moving pictures' promise 
That the party in power is said to be keeping from us. 

It is in the news that all these pitiful kin 

Are to be bought out and mercifully gathered in 

To live in villages next to the theatre and store 

328 



At the shiny desert with spots of gloom 

That might be people and are but cedar, 

Have no purpose, have no leader, 

Have never made the first move to assemble, 

And so are nothing to make her tremble. 

She can think of places that are not thus 

Without indulging a 'Not for us! 7 

Life is not so sinister-grave. 

Matter of fact has made them brave. 

He is husband, she is wife. 

She fears not him, they fear not life. 

They know where another light has been 

And more than one to theirs akin, 

But earlier out for bed tonight, 

So lost on me in my surface flight. 

This I saw when waking late, 

Going by at a railroad rate, 

Looking through wreaths of engine smoke 

Far into the lives of other folk. 



333 



THE FIGURE IN THE DOORWAY 

1 he grade surmounted, we were riding high 
Through level mountains nothing to the eye 
But scrub oak, scrub oak and the lack of earth 
That kept the oaks from getting any girth. 
But as through the monotony we ran, 
We came to where there was a living man. 
His great gaunt figure filled his cabin door, 
And had he fallen inward on the floor, 
He must have measured to the further wall. 
But we who passed were not to see him fall. 
The miles and miles he lived from anywhere 
Were evidently something he could bear. 
He stood unshaken, and if grim and gaunt, 
It was not necessarily from want. 
He had the oaks for heating and for light. 
He had a hen, he had a pig in sight. 
He had a well, he had the rain to catch. 
He had a ten by twenty garden patch. 
Nor did he lack for common entertainment. 
That I assume was what our passing train meant. 
He could look at us in our diner eating, 
And if so moved uncurl a hand in greeting. 



334 



AT WOODWARD'S GARDENS 

A boy, presuming on his intellect, 

Once showed two little monkeys in a cage 

A burning-glass they could not understand 

And never could be made to understand. 

Words are no good: to say it was a lens 

For gathering solar rays would not have helped. 

But let him show them how the weapon worked. 

He made the sun a pin-point on the nose 

Of first one then the other till it brought 

A look of puzzled dimness to their eyes 

That blinking could not seem to blink away. 

They stood arms laced together at the bars, 

And exchanged troubled glances over life. 

One put a thoughtful hand up to his nose 

As if remindedor as if perhaps 

Within a million years of an idea. 

He got his purple little knuckles stung. 

The already known had once more been confirmed 

By psychological experiment, 

And that were all the finding to announce 

Had the boy not presumed too close and long. 

There was a sudden flash of arm, a snatch 

And the glass was the monkeys' not the boy's. 

Precipitately they retired back cage 

And instituted an investigation 

On their part, though without the needed insight. 

They bit the glass and listened for the flavor. 

335 



J 'hsy broke the handle and the binding off it. 
T ben none the wiser, frankly gave it up, 
And having hid it in their bedding straw 
Against the day of prisoners' ennui, 
Came dryly forward to the bars again 
To answer for themselves: Who said it mattered 
W rut monkeys did or didn't understand? 
They might not understand a burning-glass. 
They might not understand the sun itself. 
\t's knowing what to do with things that counts. 



336 



A RECORD STRIDE 

In a Vermont bedroom closet 

With a door of two broad boards 

And for back wall a crumbling old chimney 

(And that's what their toes are to wards ), 

I have a pair of shoes standing, 
Old rivals of sagging leather, 
Who once kept surpassing each other, 
But now live even together. 

They listen for me in the bedroom 
To ask me a thing or two 
About who is too old to go walking, 
With too much stress on the who. 

I wet one last year at Moiitauk 
For a hat I had to save. 
The other I wet at the Cliff House 
In an cxtra-vagant wave. 

Two entirely different grandchildren 
Got me into my double adventure. 
But when they grow up and can read this 
I hope they won't take it for censure. 

I touch my tongue to the shoes now 
And unless my sense is at fault, 



337 



On one I can taste Atlantic, 
On the other Pacific, salt. 

One foot in each great ocean 

Is a record stride or stretch. 

The authentic shoes it was made in 

I should sell for what they would fetch. 

But instead I proudly devote them 

To my museum and muse; 

So the thick-skins needn't act thin-skinned 

About being past-active shoes. 

And I ask all to try to forgive me 
For being as over-elated 
As if I had measured the country 
And got the United States stated. 



338 



LOST IN HEAVEN 

The clouds, the source of rain, one stormy night 
Offered an opening to the source of dew; 
Which I accepted with impatient sight, 
Looking for my old skymarks in the blue. 

But stars were scarce in that part of the sky, 
And no two were of the same constellation 
No one was bright enough to identify; 
So 'twas with not ungrateful consternation, 

Seeing myself well lost once more, I sighed, 
1 Where, where in Heaven am I? But don't tell me!* 
I warned the clouds, 'by opening on me wide. 
Let's let my heavenly lostness overwhelm me/ 



339 



DESERT PLACES 

Onow falling and night falling fast oh fast 

In a field I looked into going past, 

And the ground almost covered smooth in snow, 

But a few weeds and stubble showing last. 

The woods around it have it it is theirs. 
All animals are smothered in their lairs. 
I am too absent-spirited to count; 
The loneliness includes me unawares. 

And lonely as it is that loneliness 
Will be more lonely ere it will be less 
A blanker whiteness of benighted snow 
With no expression, nothing to express. 

They cannot scare me with their empty spaces 
Between stars on stars where no human race is. 
I have it in me so much nearer home 
To scare myself with my own desert places. 



340 



LEAVES COMPARED WITH FLOWERS 

A tree's leaves may be ever so good, 

So may its bark, so may its wood; 

But unless you put the right tiling to its root 

It never will show much flower or fruit. 

But I may be one who does not care 
Ever to have tree bloom or bear. 
Leaves for smooth and bark for rough, 
Leaves and bark may be tree enough. 

Some giant trees have bloom so small 
They might as well have none at all. 
Late in life I have come on fern. 
Now lichens are due to have their turn. 

I bade men tell me which in brief, 
Which is fairer, flower or leaf. 
They did not have the wit to say, 
Leaves by night and flowers by day. 

Leaves and bark, leaves and bark, 
To lean against and hear in the dark. 
Petals I may have once pursued. 
Leaves are all my darker mood. 



341 



A LEAF TREADER 

1 have been treading ^n leaves all day until I am 

autumn-tired. 
God knows all the color and form of leaves I have 

trodden on and mired. 
Perhaps I have put forth too much strength and 

been too fierce from fear. 
I have safely trodden underfoot the leaves of another 

year. 

All summer long they were over head, more lifted 

up than I. 
To come to their final place in earth they had to 

pass me by. 
All summer long I thought I heard them threatening 

under their breath. 
And when they came it seemed with a will to carry 

me with them to death. 

They spoke to the fugitive in my heart as if it were 

leaf to leaf. 
They tapped at my eyelids and touched my lips 

with an invitation to grief. 
But it was no reason I had to go because they had 

to go. 
Now up my knee to keep on top of another year of 

snow. 



342 



THEY WERE WELCOME TO THEIR 
BELIEF 

\JTrief may have thought it was grief. 
Care may have thought it was care. 
They were welcome to their belief, 
The over important pair. 

No, it took all the snows that clung 
To the low roof over his bed, 
Beginning when he was young, 
To induce the one snow on his head. 

But whenever the roof came white 
The head in the dark below 
Was a shade less the color of night 
A shade more the color of snow. 

Grief may have thought it was grief. 
Care may have thought it was care. 
But neither one was the thief 
Of his raven color of hair. 



343 



THE STRONG ARE SAYING 
NOTHING 

ihe soil now gets a rumpling soft and damp, 
And small regard to the future of any weed. 
The final flat of the hoe's approval stamp 
Is reserved for the bed of a few selected seed. 

There is seldom more than a man to a harrowed 

piece. 

Men work olone, their lots plowed far apart, 
One stringing a chain of seed in an open crease, 
And another stumbling after a halting cart. 

To the fresh and black of the squares of early mould 
The leafless bloom of a plum is fresh and white; 
Though there's more than a doubt if the weather is 

not too cold 
For the bees to come and serve its beauty aright. 

Wind goes from farm to farm in wave on wave, 
But carries no cry of what is hoped to be. 
There may be little or much beyond the grave, 
Hut the strong are saying nothing until they see. 



344 



THE MASTER SPEED 

IN o speed of wind or water rushing by 

But you have speed far greater. You can climb 

Back up a stream of radiance to the sky, 

And back through history up the stream of time. 

And you were given this swiftness, not for haste, 

Nor chiefly that you may go where you will, 

But in the rush of everything to waste, 

That you may have the power of standing still 

Off any still or moving thing you say. 

Two such as you with such a master speed 

Cannot be parted nor be swept away 

From one another once you are agreed 

That life is only life forevermore 

Together wing to wing and oar to oar. 



345 



MOON COMPASSES 

I stole forth dimly in the dripping pause 

Between two downpours to see what there was. 

And a masked moon had spread down compass rays 

To a cone mountain in the midnight haze, 

As if the final estimate were hers, 

And as it measured in her calipers, 

The mountain stood exalted in its place. 

So love will take between the hands a face . . . 



346 



NEITHER OUT FAR NOR IN DEEP 

The people along the sand 
All turn and look one way. 
They turn their back on the land. 
They look at the sea all day. 

As long as it takes to pass 
A ship keeps raising its hull; 
The wetter ground like glass 
Reflects a standing gull. 

The land may vary more; 
But wherever the truth may be 
The water conies ashore, 
And the people look at the sea. 

They cannot look out far. 
They cannot look in deep. 
But when was that ever a bar 
To any watch they keep? 



347 



VOICE WAYS 

borne things are never clear. 
But the weather is clear tonight, 
Thanks to a clearing rain. 
The mountains are brought up near, 
The stars are brought out bright. 
Your old sweet-cynical strain 
Would come in like you here: 
'So we won't say nothing is clear.* 



348 



DESIGN 

1 found a dimpled spider, fat and white, 
On a white heal-all, holding up a moth 
Like a white piece of rigid satin cloth- 
Assorted characters of death and blight 
Mixed ready to begin the morning right, 
Like the ingredients of a witches' broth 
A snow-drop spider, a flower like froth, 
And dead wings carried like a paper kite. 

What had that flower to do with being white, 
The wayside blue and innocent heal-all? 
What brought the kindred spider to that height, 
Then steered the white moth thither in the night? 
What but design of darkness to appall? 
If design govern in a thing so small. 



349 



ON A BIRD SINGING IN ITS SLEEP 

A bird half wakened in the lunar noon 
Sang half way through its little inborn tune. 
Partly because it sang but once all night 
And that from no especial bush's height; 
Partly because it sang ventriloquist 
And had the inspiration to desist 
Almost before the prick of hostile ears, 
It ventured less in peril than appears. 
It could not have come down 1 o us so far 
Through the interstices of things ajar 
On the long bead chain of repeated birth 
To be a bird while we are men on earth 
If singing out of sleep and dream that way 
Had made it much more easily a prey. 



350 



UNHARVESTED 

A scent of ripeness from over a wall. 
And come to leave the routine road 
And look for what had made me stall, 
There sure enough was an appletrec 
That had eased itself of its summer load. 
And of all but its trivial foliage free, 
Now breathed as light as a lady's fan. 
For there there had been an apple fall 
As complete as the apple had given man. 
The ground was one circle of solid red. 

May something go always unharvested! 
May much stay out of our stated plan, 
Apples or something forgotten and left, 
So smelling their sweetness would be no theft. 



351 



THERE ARE ROUGHLY ZONES 

We sit indoors and talk of the cold outside. 

And every gust that gathers strength and heaves 

Is a threat to the house. But the house has long been 

tried. 

We think of the tree. If it never again has leaves, 
We'll know, we say, that this was the night it died. 
It is very far north, we admit, to have brought the 

peach. 

What comes over a man, is it soul or mind 
That to no limits and bounds he can stay confined? 
You would say his ambition was to extend the reach 
Clear to the Arctic of every living kind. 
Why is his nature forever so hard to teach 
That though there is no fixed line between wrong 

and right, 

There are roughly zones whose laws must be obeyed. 
There is nothing much we can do for the tree tonight. 
But we can't help feeling more than a little betrayed 
That the northwest wind should rise to such a height 

o 

fust when the cold went down so many below. 
The tree has no leaves and may never have them again. 
We must wait till some months hence in the spring 

to know. 

But if it is destined never again to grow, 
It can blame this limitless trait in the hearts of men. 



352 



A TRIAL RUN 

I said to myself almost in prayer, 

It will start hair raising currents of air 

\Vhen you give it the livid metal-sap. 

It will make a homicidal roar. 

It will shake its cast stone reef of floor. 

It will gather speed till your nerves prepare 

To hear it wreck in a thunder-clap. 

But stand your ground 

As they say in war. 

It is cotter-pinned, it is bedded true. 

Everything its parts can do 

Has been thought out and accounted for. 

Your least touch sets it going round, 

And when to stop it rests with you. 



353 



NOT QUITE SOCIAL 

Oome of you will be glad I did what I did, 
And the rest won't want to punish me too severely 
For finding a thing to do that though not forbid 
Yet wasn't enjoined and wasn't expected clearly. 

To punish me over cruelly wouldn't be right 
For merely giving you once more gentle proof 
That the city's hold on a man is no more tight 
Than when its walls rose higher than any roof. 

You may taunt me with not being able to flee the 

earth. 

You have me there, but loosely as I would be held. 
The way of understanding is partly mirth. 
I would not be taken as ever having rebelled. 

And anyone is free to condemn me to death 
If he leaves it to nature to carry out the sentence. 
I shall will to the common stock of air my breath 
And pay a death-tax of fairly polite repentance. 



354 



PROVIDE PROVIDE 

The witch that came (the withered hag) 
To wash the steps with pail and rag, 
Was once the beauty Abishag, 

The picture pride of Hollywood. 
Too many fall from great and good 
For you to doubt the likelihood. 

Die early and avoid the fate. 
Or if predestined to die late, 
Make up your mirid to die in state- 
Make the whole stock exchange your own! 
If need be occupy a throne, 
Where nobody can call you crone. 

Some have relied on what they knew; 

Others on being simply true. 

What worked for them might work for you. 

No memory of having starred 

Atones for later disregard, 

Or keeps the end from being hard. 

Better to go down dignified 

With boughten friendship at your side 

Than none at all. Provide, provide! 



355 



TEN MILLS 

PRECAUTION 

I never dared be radical when young 

For fear it would make me conservative when old. 

THE SPAN OF LIFE 

The old dog barks backward without getting up. 
I can remember when he was a pup. 

THE WRIGHTS' BIPLANE 

This biplane is the shape of hi] man flight. 
Its name might better be First Motor Kite. 
Its makers' name Time cannot get that wrong. 
For it was writ in heaven doubly Wright. 

ASSERTIVE 

Let me be the one 
To do what is done. 

EVIL TENDENCIES CANCEL 

Will the blight end the chestnut? 
The farmers rather guess not. 
It keeps smouldering at the roots 
And sending up new shoots 
Till another parasite 
Shall come to end the blight. 

356 



PERTINAX 

Let chaos storm! 

Let cloud shapes swarm! 

I wait for form. 

WASPISH 

On glossy wires artistically bent, 
He draws himself up to his full extent. 
His natty wings with self-assurance perk. 
His stinging quarters menacingly work. 
Poor egotist, he has no way of knowing 
But he's as good as anybody going. 

ONE GUESS 

He has dust in his eyes and a fan for a wing, 

A leg akimbo with which he can sing, 

And a mouthful of dye stuff instead of a sting. 

THE HARDSHIP OF ACCOUNTING 

Never ask of money spent 
Wliere the spender thinks it went. 
Nobody was ever meant 
To remember or invent 
What he did with every cent. 

NOT ALL THERE 

I turned to speak to God 
About the world's despair; 
But to make bad matters worse 



357 



I found God wasn't there. 
God turned to speak to me 
(Don't anybody laugh) 
God found I wasn't there 
At least not over half. 

IN DIVES > DIVE 

It is late at night and still I am losing, 
But still I am steady and unaccusing. 

As long as the Declaration guards 

My right to be equal in number of cards, 

It is nothing to me who runs the Dive. 
Let's have a look at another five. 



358 



THE VINDICTIVES 

You like to hear about gold. 

A king filled his prison room 

As full as the room could hold 

To the top of his reach on the wall 

With every known shape of the stuff. 

'Twas to buy himself off his doom. 

But it wasn't ransom enough. 

His captors accepted it all, 

But didn't let go of the king. 

They made him send out a call 

To his subjects to gather them more. 

And his subjects wrung all they could wring 

Out of temple and palace and store. 

But when there seemed no more to bring, 

His captors convicted the king 

Of once having started a war, 

And strangled the wretch with a string. 

But really that gold was not half 
That a king might have hoped to compel- 
Not a half, not a third, not a tithe. 
The king had scarce ceased to writhe, 
When hate gave a terrible laugh, 
Like a manhole opened to Hell. 
If gold pleased the conqueror, well, 
That gold should be the one thing 
The conqueror henceforth should lack. 

359 



They gave no more thought to the king. 
All joined in the game of hide-gold. 
They swore all the gold should go back 
Deep into the earth whence it came. 

Their minds ran on cranny and crack. 
All joined in the maddening game. 
The tale is still boastingly told 
Of many a treasure by name " 
That vanished into the black 
And put out its light for the foe. 

That self-sack and self-overthrow 
That was the splendidest sack 
Since the forest Germans sacked Rome 
And took the gold candlesticks home. 

One Inca prince on the rack, 

\nd late in his last hour alive, 

Told them in what lake to dive 

To seek what they seemed so to want. 

They dived and nothing was found. 

He told them to dive till they drowned. 

The whole fierce conquering pack 

Hunted and tortured and raged. 

There were suns of story and vaunt 

They searched for into Brazil 

Their tongues hanging out unassuaged. 



360 



But the conquered grew meek and still. 
They slowly and silently aged. 
They kept their secrets and died, 
Maliciously satisfied. 
One knew of a burial hole 
In the floor of a tribal cave, 
Where under deep ash and charcoal 
And cracked bones, human and beast, 
The midden of feast upon feast, 

Was coiled in its last resting grave 
The great treasure wanted the most, 
The great thousand-linked gold chain, 
Each link of a hundred weight, 
That once between post and post 
(In-leaning under the strain), 
And looped ten times back and forth, 
Had served as a palace gate. 
Some said it had gone to the coast, 
Some over the mountains east, 
Some into the country north, 
On the backs of a single-file host, 
Commanded by one sun-priest, 
And raising a dust with a train 
Of flashing links in the sun. 
No matter what some may say. 
(The saying is never done.) 
There bright in the filth it lay 
Untarnished by rust and decay. 
And be all plunderers curst. 

361 



'The best way to hate is the worst. 
'Tis to find what the hated need, 
Never mind of what actual worth, 
And wipe that out of the earth. 
Let them die of unsatisfied greed, 
Of unsatisfied love of display, 
Of unsatisfied love of the high, 
Unvulgar, unsoiled, and ideal. 
Let their trappings be taken away. 
Let them suffer starvation and die 
Of being brought down to the real/ 



362 



THE BEARER OF EVIL TIDINGS 

1 he bearer of evil tidings,, 
Wlien he was halfway there, 
Remembered that evil tidings 
Were a dangerous thing to bear. 

3o when he came to the parting 
Where one road led to the throne 
And one went off to the mountains 
And into the wild unknown, 

He took the one to the mountains. 
He ran through the Vale of Cashmere, 
He ran through the rhododendrons 
Till he came to the land of Pamir. 

And there in a precipice valley 
A girl of his age he met 
Took him home to her bower, 
Or he might be running yet. 

She taught him her tribe's religion: 
How ages and ages since 
A princess en route from China 
To marry a Persian prince 



Had been found with child; and her army 
Had come to a troubled halt. 



363 



And though a god was the father 
And nobody else at fault, 

It had seemed discreet to remain there 
And neither go on nor back. 
So they stayed and declared a village 
There in the land of the Yak. 

And the child that came of the princess 
Established a royal line, 
And his mandates were given heed to 
Because he was born divine. 

And that was why there were people 
On one Himalayan shelf; 
And the bearer of evil tidings 
Decided to stay there himself. 

At least he had this in common 
With the race he chose to adopt: 
They had both of them had their reasons 
For stopping where they had stopped. 

As for his evil tidings, 
Belshazzar's overthrow, 
Why hurry to tell Belshazzar 
What soon enough he would know?

IRIS BY NIGHT 

One misty evening, one another's guide, 

We two were groping down a Malvern side 

The last wet fields and dripping hedges home. 

There came a moment of confusing lights, 

Such as according to belief in Rome 

Were seen of old at Memphis on the heights 

Before the fragments of a former sun 

Could concentrate anew and rise as one. 

Light was a paste of pigment in our eyes. 

And then there was a moon and then a scene 

So watery as to seem submarine; 

In which we two stood saturated, drowned. 

The clover-mingled rowan on the ground 

Had taken all the water it could as dew, 

And still the air was saturated too, 

Its airy pressure turned to water weight. 

Then a small rainbow like a trellis gate, 

A very small moon-made prismatic bow, 

Stood closely over us through which to go. 

And then we were vouchsafed the miracle 

That never yet to other two befell 

And I alone of us have lived to tell. 

A wonder! Bow and rainbow as it bent, 

Instead of moving with us as we went, 

(To keep the pots of gold from being found) 

It lifted from its dewy pediment 

Its two mote-swimming many-colored ends, 

365 



And gathered them together in a ring. 
And we stood in it softly circled round 
From all division time or foe can bring 
In a relation of elected friends. 



366 



BUILD SOIL-A POLITICAL 
PASTORAL 

\Vhy Tityrus! But you've forgotten me. 

Fm Meliboeus the potato man, 

The one you had the talk with, you remember, 

Here on this very campus years ago. 

Hard times have struck me and I'm on the move. 

Fve had to give my interval farm up 

For interest, and I've bought a mountain farm 

For nothing down, all-out-doors of a place, 

All woods and pasture only fit for sheep. 

But sheep is what Fm going into next. 

Fm done forever with potato crops 

At thirty cents a bushel. Give me sheep. 

I know wool's down to seven cents a pound. 

But I don't calculate to sell my wool. 

I didn't my potatoes. I consumed them. 

F1I dress up in sheep's clothing and eat sheep. 

The Muse takes care of you. You live by writing 

Your poems on a farm and call that farming. 

Oh I don't blame you. I say take life easy. 

I should myself, only I don't know how. 

But have some pity on us who have to work. 

Why don't you use your talents as a writer 

To advertise our farms to city buyers, 

Or else write something to improve food prices. 

Get in a poem toward the next election. 

36? 



Oh Meliboeus, I have half a mind 

To take a writing hand in politics. 

Before now poetry has taken notice 

Of wars, and what are wars but politics 

Transformed from chronic to acute and bloody? 

I may be wrong, but Tityrus to me 

The times seem revolutionary bad. 

The question is whether they've reached a depth 

Of desperation that would warrant poetry's 

Leaving love's alternations, joy and grief, 

The weather's alternations, summer and winter, 

Our age-long theme, for the uncertainty 

Of judging who is a contemporary liar 

Who in particular, when all alike 

Get called as much in clashes of ambition. 

Life may be tragically bad, and I 

Make bold to sing it so, but do I dare 

Name names and tell you who by name is wicked? 

Whittier's luck with Skipper Ireson awes me. 

Many men's luck with Greatest Washington 

(Who sat for Stuart's portrait, but who sat 

Equally for the nation's Constitution). 

I prefer to sing safely in the realm 

Of types, composite and imagined people: 

To affirm there is such a thing as evil 

Personified, but ask to be excused 

From saying on a jury here's the guilty. 



368 



I doubt it you're convinced the times are bad. 
I keep my eye on Congress, Meliboeus. 
They're in the best position of us all 
To know if anything is very wrong. 
1 mean they could be trusted to give the alarm 
If earth were thought about to change its axis, 
Or a star coming to dilate the sun. 
As long as lightly all their live-long sessions, 
Like a yard full of school boys out at recess 
Before their plays and games were organized, 
They yelling mix tag, hide-and-seek, hop-scotch, 
And leap frog in each other's way, all's well. 
Let newspapers profess to fear the worst! 
Nothing's portentous, I am reassured. 

Is socialism needed, do you think? 

We have it now. For socialism is 
An clement in any government. 
There's no such thing as socialism pure 
Except as an abstraction of the mind. 
There's only democratic socialism 
Monarchic socialism oligarchic, 
The last being what they seem to have in Russia. 
You often get it most in monarchy, 
Least in democracy. In practice, pure, 
I don't know what it would be. No one knows. 
I have no doubt like all the loves when 
Philosophized together into one- 
One sickness of the body and the soul. 

369 



Thank God our practice holds the loves apart 

Beyond embarrassing self-consciousness 

Where natural friends are met, where dogs are 

kept, 

Where women pray with priests. There is no love. 
There's only love of men and women, love 
Of children, love of friends, of men, of God, 
Divine love, human love, parental love, 
Roughly discriminated for the rough. 

Poetry, itself once more, is back in love. 

Pardon the analogy, my Meliboeus, 
For sweeping me away. Let's see, where was I? 
But don't you think more should be socialized 
Than is? 

What should you mean by socialized? 

Made good for everyone things like inventions- 
Made so we all should get the good of them 
All, not just great exploiting businesses. 

We sometimes only get the bad of them. 

In your sense of the word ambition has 

Been socialized the first propensity 

To be attempted. Greed may well come next. 

But the worst one of all to leave uncurbed, 

Unsocialized, is ingenuity: 

Which for no sordid self-aggrandizement, 

For nothing but its own blind satisfaction 

370 



(In this it is as much like hate as love) 

Works in the dark as much against as for us. 

Even while we talk some chemist at Columbia 

Is stealthily contriving wool from jute 

That when let loose upon the grazing world 

Will put ten thousand farmers out of sheep. 

Everyone asks for freedom for himself, 

The man free love, the business man free trade, 

The writer and talker free speech and free press. 

Political ambition has been taught, 

By being punished back, it is not free: 

It must at some point gracefully refrain. 

Greed has been taught a little abnegation 

And shalUbe more before we're done with it. 

It is just fool enough to think itself 

Self-taught. But our brute snarling and lashinj 

taught it. 

None shall be as ambitious as he can. 
None should be as ingenious as he could, 
Not if I had my say. Bounds should be set 
To ingenuity for being so cruel 
In bringing change unheralded on the unready, 

I elect you to put the curb on it. 

Were I dictator, I'll tell you what Fd do. 

What should you do? 

Fd let things take their course 
And then Fd claim the credit for the outcome. 

371 



You'd make a sort of safety-first dictator. 

Don't let the things I say against myself 

Betray you into taking sides against me, 

Or it might get you into trouble with me. 

Pm not afraid to prophesy the future, 

And be judged by the outcome, Meliboeus. 

Listen and I will take my dearest risk. 

We're always too much out or too much in. 

At present from a cosmical dilation 

We're so much out that the odds are against 

Our ever getting inside in again. 

But inside in is where we've got to get. 

My friends all know Pm interpersonal. 

But long before Pm interpersonal 

Away 'way down inside Pm personal. 

Just so before we're international 

We're national and act as nationals. 

The colors are kept unmixed on the palette, 

Or better on dish plates all around the room, 

So the effect when they are mixed on canvas 

May seem almost exclusively designed. 

Some minds are so confounded intermental 

They remind me of pictures on a palette: 

'Look at what happened. Surely some God pinxit. 

Come look at my significant mud pie.' 

It's hard to tell which is the worse abhorrence 

Whether it's persons pied or nations pied. 

Don't let me seem to say the exchange, the encounter, 

372 



May not be the important thing at last. 
It well may be. We meet I don't say when 
But must bring to the meeting the maturest, 
The longest-saved-up, raciest, localest 
We have strength of reserve in us to bring. 

Tityrus, sometimes I'm perplexed myself 
To find the good of commerce. Why should 1 
Have to sell you my apples and buy yours? 
It can't be just to give the robber a chance 
To catch them and take toll of them in transit. 
Too mean a thought to get much comfort out of. 
I figure that like any bandying 
Of words or toys, it ministers to health. 
It vory likely quickens and refines us. 

To market 'tis our destiny to go. 
But much as in the end we bring for sale there 
There is still more we never bring or should bring; 
More that should be kept backthe soil for 

instance 

In my opinion, though we both know poets 
Who fall all over each other to bring soil 
And even subsoil and hardpan to market. 
To sell the hay off, let alone the soil, 
Is an unpardonable sin in farming. 
The moral is, make a late start to market. 
Let me preach to you, will you Meliboeus? 
Preach on. I thought you were already preaching. 
But preach and see if I can tell the difference. 

373 



Needless to say to you, my argument 

Is not to lure the city to the country. 

Let those possess the land and only those, 

Who love it with a love so strong and stupid 

That they may be abused and taken advantage of 

And made fun of by business, law and art; 

They still hang on. That so much of the earth's 

Unoccupied need not make us uneasy. 

We don't pretend to complete occupancy. 

The world's one globe, human society 

Another softer globe that slightly flattened 

Rests on the world, and clinging slowly rolls. 

We have our own round shape to keep unbroken. 

The world's size has no more to do with us 

Than has the universe's. We arc balls, 

We are round from the same source of roundness. 

We are both round because the mind is round, 

Because all reasoning is in a circle. 

At least that's why the universe is round. 

If what you're preaching is a line of conduct, 
[ust what am I supposed to do about it? 
Reason in circles? 

No, refuse to be 

Seduced back to the land by any claim 
The land may seem to have on man to use it. 
Let none assume to till the land but farmers. 
I only speak to you as one of them. 
You shall go to your run-out mountain farm, 

374 



Poor cast-away of commerce, and so live 
That none shall ever see you come to market- 
Not for a long long time. Plant, breed, produce, 
But what you raise or grow, why feed it out, 
Eat it or plow it under where it stands 
To build the soil. For what is more accursed 
Than an impoverished soil pale and metallic? 
What cries more to our kind for sympathy? 
I'll make a compact with you, Meliboeus, 
To match you deed for deed and plan for plan. 
Friends crowd around me with their five year plans 
That Soviet Russia has made fashionable. 
You come to me and I'll unfold to you 
A five year plan I call so, not because 
It takes ten years or so to carry out, 
Rather because it took five years at least 
To think it out. Come close, let us conspire- 
In self-restraint, if in restraint of trade. 
You will go to your run-out mountain farm 
And do what I command you, I take care 
To command only what you meant to do 
Anyway. That is my style of dictator. 
Build soil. Turn the farm in upon itself 
Until it can contain itself no more, 
But sweating-full, drips wine and oil a little. 
I will go to my run-out social mind 
And be as unsocial with it as I can. 
The thought I have, and my first impulse is 
To take to market I will turn it under. 
The thought from that thought 1 will turn it under 

375 



so on to the limit of my nature. 
We are too much out, and if we won't draw in 
We shall be driven in. I was brought up 
A state-rights free-trade Democrat. What's that ? 
An inconsistency. The state shall be 
Laws to itself, it seems, and yet have no 
Control of what it sells or what it buys. 
Suppose someone comes near me who in rate 
Of speech and thinking is so much my better 
I am imposed on, silenced and discouraged. 
Do I submit to being supplied by him 
As the more economical producer, 
More wonderful, more beautiful producer? 
No. I unostentatiously move off 
Far enough for my thought-flow to resume. 
Thought product and food product are to me 
Nothing compared to the producing of them 
I sent you once a song with the refrain: 

Let me be the one 
To do what is done 

My share at least lest I be empty-idle. 
Keep off each other and keep each other off. 
You see the beauty of my proposal is 
It needn't wait on general revolution. 
I bid you to a one-man revolution 
The only revolution that is coming. 
We're too unseparate out among each other 
With goods to sell and notions to impart. 

376 



A youngster comes to me with half a quatrain 
To ask me if I think it worth the pains 
Of working out the rest, the other half. 
I am brought guaranteed young prattle poems 
Made publicly in school, above suspicion 
Of plagiarism and help of cheating parents. 
We congregate embracing from distrust 
As much as love, and too close in to strike 
And be so very striking. Steal away 
The song says. Steal away and stay away. 
Don't join too many gangs. Join few if any. 
Join the United States and join the family 
But not much in between unless a college. 
Is it a bargain, Shepherd Meliboeus? 

Probably but you're far too fast and strong 
For my mind to keep working in your presence. 
I can tell better after I get home, 
Better a month from now when cutting posts 
Or mending fence it all comes back to me 
What I was thinking when you interrupted 
My life-train logic. I agree with you 
We're too unseparate. And going home 
From company means coming to our senses. 



377 



A MISSIVE MISSILE 

Oome one in ancient Mas cT Azil 
Once took a little pebble wheel 
And dotted it with red for me, 
And sent it to me years and years 
A million years to be precise 
Across the barrier of ice: 
Two round dots and a ripple streak, 
So vivid as to seem to speak. 
But what imperfectly appears 
Is whether the two dots were tears, 
Two tear drops, one for either eye, 
And the wave line a shaken sigh. 
But no, the color used is red. 
Not tears but drops of blood instead. 
The line must be a jagged blade. 
The sender must have had to die, 
And wanted some one now to know 
His death was sacrificial- votive. 
So almost clear and yet obscure. 
If only anyone were sure 
A motive then was still a motive. 
O you who bring this to my hand, 
You are no common messenger 
(Your badge of office is a spade). 
It grieves me to have had you stand 
So long for nothing. No reply 
There is no answer, I'm afraid, 

378 



Across the icy barrier 

For my obscure petitioner. 

Suppose his ghost is standing by 

Importunate to give the hint 

And be successfully conveyed. 

How anyone can fail to see 

Where perfectly in form and tint 

The metaphor, the symbol lies! 

Why will I not analogize? 

(I do too much in some men's eyes.) 

Oh slow uncomprehending me, 

Enough to make a spirit moan 

Or rustle in a bush or tree. 

I have the ochre- written flint, 

The two dots and the ripple line. 

The meaning of it is unknown, 

Or else I fear entirely mine, 

All modern, nothing ancient in't, 

Unsatisfying to us each. 

Far as we aim our signs to reach, 

Far as we often make them reach, 

Across the soul-from-soul abyss, 

There is an aeon-limit set 

Beyond which they are doomed to miss. 

Two souls may be too widely met. 

That sad-with-distance river beach 

"With mortal longing may beseech; 

It cannot speak as far as this. 



379 



A Witness Tree 



BEECH 

rVhere my imaginary line 
Bends square in woods., an iron spine 
And pile of real rocks have beenfounded. 
And off this corner in the wild, 
Where these are driven in and piled, 
One tree, by being deeply wounded, 
Has been impressed as Witness Tree 
And made commit to memory 
My proof of being not unbounded. 
Thus truth's established and borne out, 
Though circumstanced with dark and doubt- 
Though by a world of doubt surrounded.

THE SILKEN TENT 



is as in a field a silken tent 
At midday when a sunny summer breeze 
Has dried the dew and all its ropes relent, 
So that in guys it gently sways at ease, 
And its supporting central cedar pole, 
That is its pinnacle to heavenward 
And signifies the sureness of the soul, 
Seems to owe naught to any single cord, 
But strictly held by none, is loosely bound 
By countless silken ties of love and thought 
To everything on earth the compass round, 
And only by one's going slightly taut 
In the capriciousness of summer air 
Is of the slightest bondage made aware. 



385 



ALL REVELATION 

A head thrusts in as for the view, 
But where it is it thrusts in from 
Or what it is it thrusts into 
By that Cyb'laean avenue, 
And what can of its coming come, 

And whither it will be withdrawn, 
And what take hence or leave behind, 
These things the mind has pondered on 
A moment and still asking gone. 
Strange apparition of the mind! 

But the impervious geode 
Was entered, and its inner crust 
Of crystals with a ray cathode 
At every point and facet glowed 
In answer to the mental thrust. 

Eyes seeking the response of eyes 
Bring out the stars, bring out the flowers, 
Thus concentrating earth and skies 
So none need be afraid of size. 
All revelation has been ours. 



386 



HAPPINESS MAKES UP IN HEIGHT 
FOR WHAT IT LACKS IN LENGTH 

Oh, stormy stormy world, 
The days you were not swirled 
Around with mist and cloud. 
Or wrapped as in a shroud, 
And the sun's brilliant ball 
Was not in part or all 
Obscured from mortal view- 
Were days so very few 
I can but wonder whence 
I get the lasting sense 
Ot so much warmth and light. 
If my mistrust is right 
It may be altogether 
From one day's perfect weather, 
When starting clear at dawn, 
The day swept clearly on 
To finish clear at eve. 
I verily believe 
My fair impression may 
Be all from that one day 
No shadow crossed but ours 
As through its blazing flowers 
We went from house to wood 
For change of solitude. 



38? 



COME IN 

rVs I came to the edge of the woodsJ 
Thrush music hark! ' 

Now if it was dusk outside, 
Inside it was dark. 

Too dark in the woods for a bird 
By sleight of wing 
To better its perch for the night, 
Though it still could sing. 

The^last of the light of the sun 
That had died in the west^ 
Still lived for one song more 
In a thrush's breast. 

Far in the pillared dark 
Thrush music went 
Almost like a call to come in 
To the dark and lament. 

But no, I was out for stars: 
I would not come in. 
\ meant not even if asked, 
\nd I hadn't been. 



I COULD GIVE ALL TO TIME 

To Time it never seems that he is brave 
To set himself against the peaks of snow 
To lay them level with the running wave, 
Nor is he overjoyed when they lie low, 
But only grave, contemplative and grave. 

What now is inland shall be ocean isle, 
Then eddies playing round a sunken reef 
Like the curl at the corner of a smile; 
And I could share Time's lack of joy or grief 
At such a planetary change of style. 

I could give all to Time except except 

What I myself have held. But why declare 

The things forbidden that while the Customs slept 

I have crossed to Safety with? For I am There, 

And what I would not part with I have kept.

CAKPE DIEM 

Age saw two quiet children 

Go loving by at twilight, 

He knew not whether homeward. 

Or outward from the village, 

Or (chimes were ringing) churchward. 

He waited (they were strangers) 

Till they were oat of hearing 

To bid them both be happy. 

u Be happy, happy, happy, 

And seize the day of pleasure." 

The age-long theme is Age's. 

'Twas Age imposed on poems 

Their gather-roses burden 

To warn against the danger 

That overtaken lovers 

From being overflooded 

With happiness should have it 

And yet not know they have it. 

But bid life seize the present? 

It lives less in the present 

Than in the future always, 

And less in both together 

Than in the past. The present 

Is too much for the senses, 

Too crowding, too confusing 

;Too present to imagine.

THE WIND AND THE RAIN 



1 hat far-off day the leaves in flight 
Were letting in the colder light. 
A season-ending wind there blew 
That as it did the forest strew 
I leaned on with a singing trust 
And let it drive me deathward too. 
V/ith breaking step I stabbed the dust, 
Yet did not much to shorten stride. 
I sang of deathbut had I known 
The many deaths one must have died 
Before he came to meet his own! 
Oh, should a child be left unwarned 
That any song in which he mourned 
Would be as if he prophesied? 
It were unworthy of the tongue 
To let the half of life alone 
And play the good without the ill. 
And yet 'twould seem that what is sung 
In happy sadness by the young 
F"ate has no choice but to fulfill. 

II * 

Flowers in the desert heat 

Contrive to bloom 

On melted mountain water led by flume 

To wet their feet. 



391 



But something in it still is incomplete. 

Before I thought the wilted to exalt 

With water I would see them water-bowed. 

I would pick up all ocean less its salt, 

And though it were as much as cloud could bear 

"Would load it on to cloud, 

And rolling it inland on roller air, 

Would empty it unsparing on the flower 

That past its prime lost petals in the flood, 

(Who cares but for the future of the bud?) 

And all the more the mightier the shower 

Would run in under it to get my share. 

*Tis not enough on roots and in the mouth, 
But give me water heavy on the head 
In all the passion of a broken drouth. 

And there is always more than should be said. 

As strong is rain without as wine within, 
As magical as sunlight on the skin. 

I have been one no dwelling could contain 
When there was rain; 

But I must forth at dusk, my time of day, 
To see to the unburdening of skies. 
Rain was the tears adopted by my eyes 
That have none left to stay. 

392 



THE MOST OF IT 

Jrle thought he kept the universe alone; 

For all the voice in answer he could wake 

Was but the mocking echo of his own 

From some tree-hidden cliff across the lake. 

Some morning from the boulder-broken beach 

He would cry out on life, that what it wants 

Is not its own love back in copy speech, 

But counter-love, original response. 

And nothing ever came of what he cried 

Unless it was the embodiment that crashed 

In the cliff's talus on the other side, 

And then in the far distant water splashed, 

But after a time allowed for it to swim, 

Instead of proving human when it neared 

And someone else additional to him, 

As a great buck it powerfully appeared, 

Pushing the crumpled water up ahead, 

And landed pouring like a waterfall, 

And stumbled through the rocks with horny tread, 

And forced the underbrush and that was all. 



393 



NEVER AGAIN WOULD 

BIRDS' SONG BE THE SAME 

lie would declare and could himself believe 
That the birds there in all the garden round 
From having heard the daylong voice of Eve 
Had added to their own an oversound, 
Her tone of meaning but without the words. 
Admittedly an eloquence so soft 
Could only have had an influence on birds 
When call or laughter carried it aloft. 
Be that as may be, she was in their song 
Moreover her voice upon their voices crossed 
Had now persisted in the woods so long 
That probably it never would be lost. 
Never again would birds' song be the same. 
And to do that to birds was why she came. 



394 



WILFUL HOMING 

It is getting dark and time he drew to a house, 
But the blizzard blinds him to any house ahead. 
The storm gets down his neck in an icy souse 
That sucks his breath like a wicked cat in bed. 

The snow blows on him and off him, exerting force 
Downward to make him sit astride a drift, 
Imprint a saddle and calmly consider a course. 
He peers out shrewdly into the thick and swift. 

Since he means to come to a door he will come to a 

door, 

Although so compromised of aim and rate 
He may fumble wide of the knob a yard or more, 
And to those concerned he may seem a little late, 



395 



A CLOUD SHADOW 

A breeze discovered my open book 
And began to flutter the leaves to look 
For a poem there used to be on Spring. 
I tried to tell her "There's no such thing!" 

For whom would a poem on Spring be by? 
The breeze disdained to make reply; 
And a cloud-shadow crossed her face 
For fear I would make her miss the place. 



396 



THE QUEST OF THE 
PURPLE-FRINGED 



I felt the chill of the meadow underfoot, 

But the sun overhead; 

And snatches of verse and song of scenes like this 

I sung or said. 

I skirted the margin alders for miles and miles 
In a sweeping line. 

The day was the day by every flower that blooms, 
But I saw no sign. 

Yet further I went to be before the scythe, 

For the grass was high; 

Till I saw the path where the slender fox had come 

And gone panting by. 

Then at last and following him I found- 
In the very hour 
When the color flushed to the petals it must have 

been 
The far-sought flower. 

There stood the purple spires with no breath of air 
Nor headlong bee 

To disturb their perfect poise the livelong day 
'Neath the alder tree. 

397 



i only knelt and putting the boughs aside 
Looked., or at most 

Counted them all to the buds in the copse's depth 
That were pale as a ghost. 

Then I arose and silently wandered home, 
And I for one 

Said that the fall might come and whirl of leaves. 
For summer was done.

THE GIFT OUTRIGHT 

1 he land was ours before we were the land's. 
She was our land more than a hundred years 
Before we were her people. She was ours 
In Massachusetts, in Virginia, 
But we were England's, still colonials, 
Possessing what we still were unpossessed by, 
Possessed by what we now no more possessed. 
Something we were withholding made us weak 
Until we found it was ourselves 
We were withholding from our land of living, 
And forthwith found salvation in surrender. 
Such as we were we gave ourselves outright 
(The deed of gift was many deeds of war) 
To the land vaguely realizing westward, 
But still unstoried, artless, uiienhanced, 
Such as she was, such as she would become.

TRIPLE BRONZE 

ihe Infinite's being so wide 
Is the reason the Powers provide 
For inner defense my hide. 
For next defense outside 

I make myself this time 
Of wood or granite or lime 
A wall too hard for crime 
Either to breach or climb. 

Then a number of us agree 
On a national boundary. 
And that defense makes three 
Between too much and me.

OUR HOLD ON THE PLANET 

\Ve asked for rain. It didn't flash and roar. 

It didn't lose its temper at our demand 

And blow a gale. It didn't misunderstand 

And give us more than our spokesman bargained 

for; 

And just because we owned to a wish for rain, 
Send us a flood and bid us be damned and drown. 
It gently threw us a glittering shower down. 
And when we had taken that into the roots of grain, 
It threw us another and then another still 
Till the spongy soil again was natal wet. 
We may doubt the just proportion of good to ill. 
There is much in nature against us. But we forget: 
Take nature altogether since time began, 
Including human nature, in peace and war, 
And it must be a little more in favor of man, 
Say a fraction of one per cent at the very least, 
Or our number living wouldn't be steadily more, 
Our hold on the planet wouldn't have so increased.

TO A YOUNG WRETCH 

(BOETHIAN) 

As gay for you to take your father's axe 

As take his gun rod to go hunting fishing. 

You nick my spruce until its fiber cracks. 

It gives up standing straight and goes down swishing. 

You link an arm in its arm and you lean 

Across the light snow homeward smelling green. 

[ could have bought you just as good a tree 

To frizzle resin in a candle flame, 

And what a saving 'twould have meant to me. 

But tree by charity is not the same 

As tree by enterprise and expedition. 

I must not spoil your Christmas with contrition. 

It is your Christmases against my woods. 
But even where thus opposing interests kill, 
They are to be thought of as opposing goods 
Oftener than as conflicting good and ill; 
Which makes the war god seem no special dunce 
For always fighting on both sides at once. 

And though in tinsel chain and popcorn rope, 
My tree a captive in your window bay 
Has lost its footing on my mountain slope 
And lost the stars of heaven, may, oh, may 
The symbol star it lifts against your ceiling 
Help me accept its fate with Christmas feeling.

THE LESSON FOR TODAY 

If this uncertain age in which we dwell 
Were really as dark as I hear sages tell, 
And I convinced that they were really sages, 
I should not curse myself with it to hell, 
But leaving not the chair I long have sat in, 
I should betake me back ten thousand pages 
To the world's undebatably dark ages, 
And getting up my mediaeval Latin, 
Seek converse common cause and brotherhood 
(By all that's liberalI should, I should) 
With poets who could calmly take the fate 
Of being born at once too early and late, 
And for these reasons kept from being great. 
Yet singing but Dione in the wood 
And uer aspergit terramfloribus 
They slowly led old Latin verse to rhyme 
And to forget the ancient lengths of time, 
And so began the modern world for us. 

Td say, O Master of the Palace School, 

You were not Charles' nor anybody's fool: 

Tell me as pedagogue to pedagogue* 

You did not know that since King Charles did rule 

You had no chance but to be minor, did you? 

Your light was spent perhaps as in a fog 

That at once kept you burning low and hid you. 

The age may very well have been to blame 

For your not having won to Virgil's fame. 

403 



But no one ever heard you make the claim. 

You would not think you knew enough to judge 

The age when full upon you. That's my point. 

We have to-day and I could call their name 

Who know exactly what is out of joint 

To make their verse and their excuses lame. 

They've tried to grasp with too much social fact 

Too large a situation. You and I 

Would be afraid if we should comprehend 

And get outside of too much bad statistics 

Our muscles never could again contract: 

We never could recover human shape, 

But must live lives out mentally agape, 

Or die of philosophical distension. 

That's how we feel and we're no special mystics. 

We can't appraise the time in which we act. 
But for the folly of it, let's pretend 
We know enough to know it for adverse. 
One more millennium's about to end. 
Let's celebrate the event, my distant friend, 
In publicly disputing which is worse, 
The present age or your age. You and I 
As schoolmen of repute should qualify 
To wage a fine scholastical contention 
As to whose age deserves the lower mark, 
Or should I say the higher one, for dark. 
I can just hear the way you make it go: 
There's always something to be sorry for, 
A sordid peace or an outrageous war. 

404 



Yes, yes, of course. We have the same convention. 

The groundwork of all faith is human woe. 

It was well worth preliminary mention. 

There's nothing but injustice to be had, 

No choice is left a poet, you might add, 

But how to take the curse, tragic or comic. 

It was well worth preliminary mention. 

But let's get on to where our cases part, 

If part they do. Let me propose a start. 

(We're rivals in the badness of our case, 

Remember, and must keep a solemn face.) 

Space ails us moderns: we are sick with space, 

Its contemplation makes us out as small 

As a brief epidemic of microbes 

That in a good glass may be seen to crawl 

The patina of this the least of globes. 

But have we there the advantage after all? 

You were belittled into vilest worms 

God hardly tolerated with his feet; 

Which comes to the same thing in different terms. 

We both are the belittled human race, 

One as compared with God and one with space, 

I had thought ours the more profound disgrace; 

But doubtless this was only my conceit. 

The cloister and the observatory safnt 

Take comfort in about the same complaint. 

So science and religion really meet. 



I can just hear you call your Palace class: 
Come learn the Latin Eheu for alas. 



403 



You may not want to use it and you may. 
O paladins, the lesson for to-day 
Is how to be unhappy yet polite. 
And at the summons Roland, Olivier, 
And every sheepish paladin and peer, 
Being already more than proved in fight, 
Sits down in school to try if he can write 
Like Horace in the true Horatian vein, 
Yet like a Christian disciplined to bend 
His mind to thinking always of the end. 
Memento mori and obey the Lord. 
Art and religion love the somber chord. 
Earth's a hard place in which to save the soul, 
And could it be brought under state control, 
So automatically we all were saved, 
Its separateness from Heaven could be waive 
It might as well at once be kingdom-come. 
(Perhaps it will be next millennium.) 

But these are universals, not confined 
To any one time, place, or human kind. 
We're either nothing or a God's regret. 
As ever when philosophers are met, 
No matter where they stoutly mean to get, 
Nor what particulars they reason from, 
They are philosophers, and from old habit 
They end up in the universal Whole 
As unoriginal as any rabbit. 



406 



One age is like another for the soul. 
I'm telling you. You haven't said a thing, 
Unless I put it in your mouth to say. 
Fm having the whole argument my way 
But in your favorplease to tell your King- 
In having granted you all ages shine 
With equal darkness, yours as dark as mine. 
I'm liberal. You, you aristocrat 
Won't know exactly what I mean by that. 
I mean so altruistically moral 
I never take my own side in a quarrel. 
Fd lay my hand on his hand on his staff, 
Lean back and have my confidential laugh, 
And tell him I had read his Epitaph. 

It sent me to the graves the other day. 

The only other there was far away 

Across the landscape with a watering pot 

At his devotions in a special plot. 

And he was there resuscitating flowers 

(Make no mistake about its being bones); 

But I was only there to read the stones 

To see what on the whole they had to say 

About how long a man may think to live, 

Which is becoming my concern of fete. 

And very wide the choice they seemed to give; 

The ages ranging all the way from hours 

To months and years and many many years. 

One man had lived one hundred years and eight. 

But though we all may be inclined to wait 

407 



And follow some development of state, 

Or see what comes of science and invention, 

There is a limit to our time extension. 

We all are doomed to broken-off careers, 

And so's the nation, so's the total race. 

The earth itself is liable to the fate 

Of meaninglessly being broken off. 

(And hence so many literary tears 

At which my inclination is to scoff. ) 

I may have wept that any should have died 

Or missed their chance, or not have been their best, 

Or been their riches, fame, or love denied; 

On me as much as any is the jest. 

I take my incompleteness with the rest. 

God bless himself can no one else be blessed. 

I hold your doctrine of Memento Mori. 
And were an epitaph to be my story 
I'd have a short one ready for my own. 
I would have written of me on my stone: 
I had a lovers quarrel with the world. 



408 



TIME OUT 

It took that pause to make him realize 

The mountain he was climbing had the slant 

As of a book held up before his eyes 

(And was a text albeit done in plant). 

Dwarf cornel, gold-thread, and maianthemum, 

He following fingered as he read, 

The flowers fading on the seed to come; 

But the thing was the slope it gave his head: 

The same for reading as it was for thought, 

So different from the hard and level stare 

Of enemies defied and battles fought. 

It was the obstinately gentle air 

That may be clamored at by cause and sec*. 

But it will have its moment to reflect. 



409 



TO A MOTH SEEN IN WINTER 

Here's first a gloveless hand warm from my pocket, 
A perch and resting place 'twixt wood and wood, 
Bright-black-eyed silvery creature, brushed with 

brown, 

The wings not folded in repose, but spread. 
(Who would you be, I wonder, by those marks 
If I had moths to friend as I have flowers?) 
And now pray tell what lured you with false hope 
To make the venture of eternity 
And seek the love of kind in winter time? 
But stay and hear me out. I surely think 
You make a labor of flight for one so airy, 
Spending yourself too much in self-support. 
Nor will you find love either nor love you. 
And what I pity in you is something human, 
The old incurable untimeliness, 
Only begetter of all ills that are. 
But go. You are right. My pity cannot help. 
Go till you wet your pinions and are quenched. 
You must be made more simply wise than I 
To know the hand I stretch impulsively 
Across the gulf of well nigh everything 
May reach to you, but cannot touch your fate. 
I cannot touch your life, much less can save, 
Who am tasked to save my own a little while. 

CIRCA 1900

A CONSIDERABLE SPECK 
(MICROSCOPIC) 

A speck that would have been beneath my sight 

On any but a paper sheet so white 

Set off across what I had written there. 

And I had idly poised my pen in air 

To stop it with a period of ink 

When something strange about it made me think, 

This was no dust speck by my breathing blown, 

But unmistakably a living mite 

With inclinations it could call its own. 

It paused as with suspicion of my pen, 

And then came racing wildly on again 

To where my manuscript was not yet dry; 

Then paused again and either drank or smelt 

"With loathing, for again it turned to fly. 

Plainly with an intelligence I dealt. 

It seemed too tiny to have room for feet, 

Yet must have had a set of them complete 

To express how much it didn't want to die. 

It ran with terror and with cunning crept. 

It faltered: I could see it hesitate; 

Then in the middle of the open sheet 

Cower down in desperation to accept 

Whatever I accorded it of fate. 

I have none of the tenderer-than-thou 

Collectivistic regimenting love 

With which the modern world is being swept. 

411 



But this poor microscopic item now! 
Since it was nothing I knew evil of 
I let it lie there till I hope it slept. 

I have a mind myself and recognize 
Mind when I meet with it in any guise. 
No one can know how glad I am to find 
On any sheet the least display of mind. 



412 



THE LOST FOLLOWER 

As I have known them passionate and fine 
The gold for which they leave the golden line 
Of lyric is a golden light divine, 
Never the gold of darkness from a mine. 

The spirit plays us strange religious pranks 
To whatsoever god we owe the thanks. 
No one has ever failed the poet ranks 
To link a chain of money-metal banks. 

The loss to song, the danger of defection 
Is always in the opposite direction. 
Some turn in sheer, in Shelleyan dejection 
To try if one more popular election 

Will give us by short cut the final stage 

That poetry with all its golden rage 

For beauty on the illuminated page 

Has failed to bring I mean the Golden Age. 

And if this may not be (and nothing's sure), 
At least to live ungolden with the poor, 
Enduring what the ungolden must endure. 
This has been poetry's great anti-lure. 

The muse mourns one who went to his retreat 
Long since in some abysmal city street, 

413 



The bride who shared the crust he broke to eat 
As grave as he about the world's defeat. 

With such it has proved dangerous as friend 
Even in a playful moment to contend 
That the millennium to which you bend 
In longing is not at a progress-end 

By grace of state-manipulated pelf, 
Or politics of Ghibelline or Guelph, 
But right beside you book-like on a shelf, 
Or even better god-like in yourself. 

He trusts my love too well to deign reply. 
But there is in the sadness of his eye, 
Something about a kingdom in the sky 
(As yet unbrought to earth) he means to try. 



414 



NOVEMBER 

\Ve saw leaves go to glory, 
Then almost migratory 
Go part way down the lane, 
And then to end the story 
Get beaten down and pasted 
In one wild day of rain. 
We heard " 'Tis over" roaring. 
A year of leaves was wasted. 
Oh, we make a boast of storing, 
Of saving and of keeping, 
But only by ignoring 
The waste of moments sleeping, 
The waste of pleasure weeping, 
By denying and ignoring 
The waste of nations warring.

THE RABBIT HUNTER 

(Careless and still 
The hunter lurks 
With gun depressed, 
Facing alone 
The alder swamp? 
Ghastly snow-white. 
And his hound works 
In the ofiing there 
Like one possessed, 
And yelps delight 
And sings and romps, 
Bringing him on 
The shadowy hare 
For him to rend 
And deal a death 
That he nor it 
(Nor I) have wit 
To comprehend.

A LOOSE MOUNTAIN 
(TELESCOPIC) 

JDid you stay up last night (the Magi did) 

To see the star shower known as Leonid 

That once a year by hand or apparatus 

Is so mysteriously pelted at us? 

It is but fiery puffs of dust and pebbles, 

No doubt directed at our heads as rebels 

In having taken artificial light 

Against the ancient sovereignty of night. 

A fusillade of blanks and empty flashes, 

It never reaches earth except as ashes 

Of which you feel no least touch on your face 

Nor find in dew the slightest cloudy trace. 

Nevertheless it constitutes a hint 

That the loose mountain lately seen to glint 

In sunlight near us in momentous swing 

Is something in a Balearic sling 

The heartless and enormous Outer Black 

Is still withholding in the Zodiac 

But from irresolution in his back 

About when best to have us in our orbit, 

So we won't simply take it and absorb it. 



417 



IT IS ALMOST THE YEAR 
TWO THOUSAND 

To start the world of old 
We had one age of gold 
Not labored out of mines, 
And some say there are signs 
The second such has come, 
The true Millennium, 
The final golden glow 
To end it. And if so 
(And science ought to know) 
We well may raise our heads 
From weeding garden beds 
And annotating books 
To watch this end de luxe.

ON OUR SYMPATHY WITH 
THE UNDER DOG 

Jrirst under up and then again down under, 

We watch a circus of revolving dogs 

No senator dares in to kick asunder 

Lest both should bite him in the toga-togs.

A QUESTION 

A voice said. Look me in the stars 
And tell me truly, men of earth, 
If all the soul-and-body scars 
Were not too much to pay for birth.

That wisdom need not be of Athens Attic, 
But well may be Laconic., even Boeotian. 
At least I will not have it systematic.

THE SECRET SITS

But the Secret sits in the middle and knows.

A SEMI-REVOLUTION 

1 advocate a semi-revolution. 

The trouble with a total revolution 

(Ask any reputable Rosicrucian) 

Is that it brings the same class up on top. 

Executives of skillful execution 

Will therefore plan to go half-way and stop. 

Yes, revolutions are the only salves, 

But they're one thing that should be done by halves

The danger not an inch outside 
Behind the porthole's slab of glass 
And double ring of fitted brass 
L trust feels properly defied.

But Islands of the Blessed, bless you son, 
I never came upon a blessed one. 



425 



TRESPASS 

INO, I had set no prohibiting sign, 
And yes, my land was hardly fenced. 
Nevertheless the land was mine: 
I was being trespassed on and against. 

Whoever the surly freedom took 
Of such an unaccountable stay 
Busying by my woods and brook 
Gave me strangely restless day. 

He might be opening leaves of stone., 
The picture-book of the trilobite, 
For which the region round was known,, 
And in which there was little property right. 

'Twas not the value I stood to lose 
In specimen crab in specimen rock, 
But his ignoring what was whose 
That made me look again at the clock. 

Then came his little acknowledgment: 
He asked for a drink at the kitchen door, 
An errand he may have had to invent, 
But it made my property mine once more.

A NATURE NOTE 

Jr our or five whippoorwills 

Have come down from their native ledge 

To the open country edge 

To give us a piece of their bills. 

Two in June were a pair 
You'd say sufficiently loud, 
But this was a family crowd, 
A full-fledged family affair. 

All out of time pell-mell! 
I wasn't in on the joke 
Unless it was coming to folk 
To bid us a mock farewell. 

I took note of when it occurred, 
The twenty-third of September, 
Their latest that I remember, 
September the twenty-third. 



427 



OF THE STONES OF THE PLACE 

1 farm a pasture where the boulders lie 
As touching as a basket full of eggs. 
And though they're nothing anybody begs, 
I wonder if it wouldn't signify 

For me to send you one out where you live 
In wind-soil to a depth of thirty feet, 
And every acre good enough to eat, 
As fine as flour put through a baker's sieve. 

I'd ship a smooth one you could slap and chafe, 

And set up like a statue in your yard, 

An eolith palladium to guard 

The West and keep the old tradition safe. 

Carve nothing on it. You can simply say 
In self-defense to quizzical inquiry: 
"The portrait of the soul of my gransir Ira. 
It came from where he came from anyway." 



A SERIOUS STEP LIGHTLY TAKEN 

Between two burrs on the map 

Was a hollow-headed snake. 

The burrs were hills, the snake was a stream, 

And the hollow head was a lake. 

And the dot in front of a name 

Was what should be a town. 

And there might be a house we could buy 

For only a dollar down. 

With two wheels low in the ditch 

We left our boiling car, 

And knocked at the door of a house we found, 

And there to-day we are. 

It is turning three hundred years 
On our cisatlantic shore 
For family after family name. 
We'll make it three hundred more 

For our name farming here, 
Aloof yet not aloof, 
Enriching soil and increasing stock, 
Repairing fence and roof; 



429 



A hundred thousand days 
Of front-page paper events, 
A half a dozen major wars, 
And forty-five presidents.

THE LITERATE FARMER AND THE 
PLANET VENUS 

A Dated Popular-Science Medley 
on a Mysterious Light Recently Observed in the 
Sky at Evening 



JVly unexpected knocking at the door 

Started chairs thundering on the kitchen floor, 

Knives and forks ringing on the supper plates, 

Voices conflicting like the candidates. 

A mighty farmer flung the house door wide, 

He and a lot of children came outside, 

And there on an equality we stood. 

That's the time knocking at a door did good. 

"I stopped to compliment you on this star 
You get the beauty of from where you are. 
To see it so, the bright and only one 
In sunset light, you'd think it was the sun 
That hadn't sunk the way it should have sunk, 
But right in heaven was slowly being shrunk 
So small as to be virtually gone, 
Yet there to watch the darkness coming on 
Like someone dead permitted to exist 
Enough to see if he was greatly missed. 
I didn't see the sun set. Did it set? 
Will anybody swear that isn't it? 
And will you give me shelter for the night? 
If not, a glass of rnilk will be all right. " 

431 



4 'Traveler, I'm glad you asked about that light. 
Your mind mistrusted there was something wrong, 
And naturally you couldn't go along 
Without inquiring if 'twas serious. 
'Twas providential you applied to us, 
Who were just on the subject when you came. 
There is a star that's Serious by name 
And nature too, but this is not the same. 
This light's been going on for several years, 
Although at times we think it disappears. 
You'll hear all sorts of things. You'll meet with them 
Will tell you it's the star of Bethlehem 
Above some more religion in a manger. 
But put that down to superstition, Stranger. 
What's a star doing big as a baseball? 
Between us two it's not a star at all. 
It's a new patented electric light, 
Put up on trial by that Jerseyite 
So much is being now expected of, 
To give developments the final shove 
And turn us into the next specie folks 
Are going to be, unless these monkey jokes 
Of the last fifty years are all a libel, 
And Darwin's proved mistaken, not the Bible. 
I s'pose you have your notions on the vexed 
Question of what we're turning into next." 

"As liberals we're willing to give place 
To any demonstrably better race, 
No matter what the color of its skin. 

432 



(But what a human race the white has been!) 

I heard a fellow in a public lecture 

On Pueblo Indians and their architecture 

Declare that if such Indians inherited 

The condemned world the legacy was merited. 

So far as he, the speaker, was concerned 

He had his ticket bought, his passage earned, 

To take the Mayflower back where he belonged 

Before the Indian race was further wronged. 

But come, enlightened as in talk you seem, 

You don't believe that that first-water gleam 

Is not a star?" 

''Believe it? Why, I know it. 
Its actions any cloudless night will show it. 
You'll see it be allowed up just so high, 
Say about halfway up the western sky, 
And then get slowly, slowly pulled back down. 

You might not notice if you've lived in town, 

As I suspect you have. A town debars 

Much notice of what's going on in stars. 

The idea is no doubt to make one job 

Of lighting the whole night with one big blob 

Of electricity in bulk the way 

The sun sets the example in the day." 

"Here come more stars to character the skies, 
And they in the estimation of the wise 
Are more divine than any bulb or arc, 

433 



Because their purpose is to flash and spark. 
But not to take away the precious dark. 
We need the interruption of the night 
To ease attention off when overtight, 
To break our logic in too long a flight, 
And ask us if our premises are right." 

"Sick talk, sick talk, sick sentimental talk! 
It doesn't do you any good to walk. 
I see what you are: can't get you excited 
With hopes of getting mankind unbenighted. 
Some ignorance takes rank as innocence. 
Have it for all of me and have it dense. 
The slave will never thank his manumitter; 
Which often makes the manumitter bitter.'' 

u ln short, you think that star a patent medicine 
Put up to cure the world by Mr. Edison." 

"You said it that's exactly what it is. 
My son in Jersey says a friend of his 
Knows the old man and nobody's so deep 
In incandescent lamps and ending sleep. 
The old man argues science cheapened speed. 
A good cheap anti-dark is now the need. 
Give us a good cheap twenty-four-hour day, 
No part of which we'd have to waste, I say, 
And who knows where we can't get! Wasting time 
In sleep or slowness is the deadly crime. 
He gave up sleep himself some time ago, 

434 



It puffs the face and brutalizes so. 
You take the ugliness all so much dread, 
Called getting out of the wrong side of bed. 
That is the source perhaps of human hate, 
And well may be where wars originate. 
Get rid of that and there' d be left no great 
Of either murder or war in any land. 
You know how cunningly mankind is planned: 
We have one loving and one hating hand. 
The loving's made to hold each other like, 
While with the hating other hand we strike. 
The blow can be no stronger than the clutch, 
Or soon we'd bat each other out of touch, 
And the fray wouldn't last a single round. 
And still it's bad enough co badly wound, 
And if our getting up to start the day 
On the right side of bed would end the fray, 
We'd hail the remedy. But it's been tried 
And found, he says, a bed has no right side.
